| FIRST | 0.0% | 9.8% | 22.1% | 64.0% |

**Critical Finding:** Third Chamber concentration in 2023-2024 coincides with compensation case surge.

## 5. Count Variable Trends

### 5.1 Judge Count (Proxy for Chamber Size)

| Period | Mean Judges | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 2019-2020 | 10.6 | More Grand Chamber |
| 2023-2024 | 6.2 | More small chambers |
| 2025 | 5.6 | Small chambers dominant |

## 6. Candidate Break Points

### 6.1 Primary Candidate: 2023 (Article 82 Surge)

**Evidence:**
- Compensation cases: 1.9% (pre-2023) → 27.1% (2023+)
- Pro-DS rate: 69.2% (pre-2023) → 57.4% (2023+)
- Third Chamber: 7.7% (pre-2023) → 26.4% (2023+)

**Interpretation:** The 2023 break point shows simultaneous:
1. Compositional shift (more compensation cases)
2. Institutional shift (more Third Chamber)
3. Outcome shift (lower pro-DS rate)

This is the **strongest candidate** for structural break analysis.

### 6.2 Secondary Candidates

| Candidate | Evidence | Strength |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Third Chamber concentration | 42% of 2024 holdings | Moderate |
| Grand Chamber decline | 72% → 12% | Strong |
| Principle-based reasoning decline | 64% → 41% | Moderate |

## 7. Key Implications for Subsequent Phases

### For Phase 2 (Bivariate Tests):
- Test whether pro-DS rate decline is statistically significant (Cochran-Armitage)
- Test compositional shifts (chi-square for concept × period)
- Quantify chamber × year association

### For Phase 3 (Multivariate Models):
- Include year as covariate; test whether pro-DS purpose effect persists
- Test period × chamber interaction
- Test whether time effect disappears controlling for compensation cases

### For Phase 4 (Decomposition):
- Critical: Separate composition effect (more compensation) from coefficient effect (genuine doctrinal shift)
- Hypothesis: Most of observed decline is compositional, not genuine doctrinal change

---

## 8. Preliminary Conclusions

1. **Descriptive Decline Confirmed:** Pro-DS rate dropped from ~69% (2019-2022) to ~57% (2023-2025)

2. **Compositional Shift Dominant:** The surge in Article 82 compensation cases (from 0% to 27%) is the most dramatic compositional change and likely explains much of the apparent decline

3. **Institutional Shift:** Grand Chamber cases declined; Third Chamber increased precisely when compensation cases surged

4. **Methodological Stability:** Interpretive methods (teleological, semantic, systematic) remain stable; no evidence of methodological revolution

5. **2023 Break Point:** Strong candidate for structural break analysis based on convergent compositional, institutional, and outcome shifts
