A7: The GDPR does not provide a judicial remedy for data subjects to obtain preventive injunctions against future unlawful processing, but Member States may establish such remedies under national law.

A13: It should be noted that the GDPR contains no provisions which provide, explicitly or implicitly, that the data subject enjoys, as envisaged by the referring court, a right to obtain, as a preventive measure and by means of judicial proceedings, an order that the controller of personal data refrain, in future, from committing an infringement of the provisions of that regulation.
A14: TRUE
A15: As a preliminary point, it must be borne in mind that, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also its context and the objectives pursued by the legislation of which it forms part.
A16: TRUE
A17: The possibility for the data subject to bring a legal action seeking an order requiring a controller to refrain, in future, from infringing the substantive provisions of the GDPR does not undermine those objectives but is, in fact, such as to enhance the effectiveness of those provisions and thus the high level of protection of data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data, pursued by that regulation.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: The wording of that provision does not require Member States to provide for a specific legal remedy whereby a prohibitory injunction may be obtained, as a preventive measure, by means of a legal action, as envisaged by the referring court.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has repeatedly held, EU law, including the provisions of the Charter, does not have the effect of requiring Member States to establish remedies other than those established by national law, unless it is apparent from the overall scheme of the national legal system in question that no legal remedy exists that would make it possible to ensure, even indirectly, respect for the rights that individuals derive from EU law.
A26: C-21/23, C-659/22, C-507/23, C-710/23, C-530/23

A7: Non-material damage under Article 82(1) includes negative feelings such as fear or annoyance caused by loss of control over personal data, potential misuse, or reputational harm from unauthorized data transmission.
A8: Article 82(1)
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: It should be observed that Article 82(1) of the GDPR provides that any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of that regulation is entitled to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.
A14: TRUE
A15: In accordance with settled case-law, having regard to the absence of any reference in Article 82(1) of the GDPR to the domestic law of the Member States, the concept of 'non-material damage', within the meaning of that provision, must be given an autonomous and uniform definition specific to EU law.
A16: TRUE
A17: In addition, it is supported by the objective of that regulation, as set out in Article 1 and recitals 1 and 10 thereof, which is to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION
A19: NULL
A20: TELEOLOGICAL
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It is apparent from the illustrative list of types of 'damage' that may be suffered by data subjects set out in the first sentence of recital 85 of the GDPR that the EU legislature intended to include in that concept, inter alia, mere 'loss of control' over the personal data of those data subjects.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has previously held that the fear experienced by a data subject that his or her personal data will be misused in the future as a result of an infringement of the GDPR, is capable, in itself, of constituting 'non-material damage', within the meaning of Article 82(1) thereof.
A26: C-687/21, C-200/23, C-300/21, C-590/22, C-456/22
A27: TRUE
A28: That interpretation is consistent with the wording of Article 82(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recitals 85 and 146 of that regulation, which encourage the acceptance of a broad interpretation of the concept of 'non-material damage'.
A29: CASE_LAW_BASED
A30: FALSE
A31: NULL
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Broad interpretation of non-material damage to include negative feelings without requiring a severity threshold expands data subjects' ability to claim compensation.

A7: The degree of fault on the part of the controller cannot be taken into account when assessing the amount of compensation for non-material damage under Article 82(1) GDPR.
A8: Article 82(1), Article 83
A9: 82, 83
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: It is apparent from the case-law of the Court that, since the GDPR does not contain any provision intended to define the rules on the assessment of damages payable under the right to compensation enshrined in Article 82 of that regulation, national courts must, to that end, apply the domestic rules of each Member State.
A14: TRUE
A15: In contrast to what is provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR for administrative fines, the criteria for which are not applicable mutatis mutandis in the context of Article 82 of that regulation, the right to compensation provided for in Article 82, in particular in the case of non-material damage, fulfils an exclusively compensatory function.
A16: TRUE
A17: The Court has held that, in view of the compensatory function of the right to compensation under Article 82 of the GDPR, national courts are required to ensure 'full and effective' compensation for the damage suffered.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION
A19: NULL

A22: TRUE
A23: Thus, first, establishing the liability of the controller under Article 82 of the GDPR is subject to fault on the part of the controller, which is presupposed unless the controller proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has held that, in view of the compensatory function of the right to compensation under Article 82 of the GDPR, national courts are required to ensure 'full and effective' compensation for the damage suffered, as stated in recital 146 of that regulation.
A26: C-300/21, C-507/23, C-200/23
A27: TRUE
A28: The right to compensation provided for in Article 82, in particular in the case of non-material damage, fulfils an exclusively compensatory function, in that financial compensation based on Article 82 must allow the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in full, and not a deterrent or punitive function.
A29: CASE_LAW_BASED
A30: FALSE

A8: Article 82(1)
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: It is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraphs 78 and 79 above that a form of compensation provided for by the applicable national law may be regarded as compatible with the GDPR only in so far as that form of compensation is in line with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law.
A14: TRUE
A15: In particular, compensation payable under Article 82 of that regulation cannot be awarded, in part or in full, in the form of a prohibitory injunction, since the right to compensation for damage provided for in Article 82 fulfils an exclusively compensatory function.
A16: TRUE
A17: In particular, it should be noted that the criteria for assessing the compensation payable in the context of actions intended to safeguard the rights which individuals derive from Article 82 of the GDPR, criteria which are prescribed within the legal system of each Member State, must ensure that the compensation for the damage suffered by the data subject as a result of an infringement of that regulation is full and effective.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It must be borne in mind that, as mentioned in paragraph 66 above, the GDPR contains no provisions defining the rules for assessing damages payable under Article 82 of that regulation, with the result that national courts must, to that end, apply the domestic rules of each Member State relating to the extent of financial compensation.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has previously accepted that, within the limits stemming from the principle of effectiveness, certain circumstances may influence the assessment of compensation payable under Article 82 of the GDPR, especially in order to restrict that compensation.
A26: C-200/23, C-507/23
A27: TRUE
A28: An injunction of that kind is aimed at preventing the recurrence of acts which have caused damage, so that no further damage occurs, but does not redress damage already suffered by the data subject.
A29: CASE_LAW_BASED
