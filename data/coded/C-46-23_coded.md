A13: It is quite clear, on the one hand, from the wording of Article 58(2)(c) of the GDPR that the corrective power referred to in that provision, namely 'to order the controller or the processor to comply with the data subject's requests to exercise his or her rights pursuant to this Regulation', presupposes that a data subject has first asserted his or her rights by submitting a request for that purpose.
A14: TRUE
A15: It must thus be inferred that that provision governs two independent situations, namely, on the one hand, the erasure of data at the request of the data subject and, on the other, erasure arising from the existence of a standalone obligation borne by the controller, irrespective of any request from the data subject.
A16: TRUE
A17: Lastly, such an interpretation is also borne out by the objective pursued by Article 58(2) of the GDPR, as apparent from recital 129 thereof, which is namely to ensure that the processing of personal data complies with that regulation and to make good situations where there has been a breach of that regulation so as to make them conform with EU law, as a result of intervention by the national supervisory authorities.

A23: Under Article 58(2)(d) of the GDPR, the supervisory authority may order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of that regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, the Court has already stated that if a national supervisory authority takes the view, following an investigation, that a data subject is not afforded an adequate level of protection, it is required, under EU law, to take appropriate action in order to remedy any findings of inadequacy, irrespective of the reason for, or nature of, that inadequacy.

A27: TRUE
A28: Consequently, in order to ensure effective application of the GDPR, it is of particular importance that that authority has genuine powers to take effectual action against infringements of that regulation, and in particular to bring them to an end, including in situations where data subjects have not been informed that their personal data have been processed, are not aware of it, or in any event have not requested the erasure of those data.

A13: In that regard, it should be observed, first of all, that the wording of the provisions referred to in the preceding paragraph contains nothing to suggest that the ability of the supervisory authority to exercise the corrective powers listed therein is contingent on the origin of the data concerned, and in particular on whether they were collected from the data subject.
A14: TRUE
A15: Likewise, the wording of Article 17(1) of the GDPR, which, as is apparent from paragraph 37 above, imposes a standalone obligation on the controller to erase unlawfully processed personal data, does not include any requirement as to the origin of the data collected.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such an interpretation is also borne out by the objectives pursued by the GDPR, in particular by Article 58(2) of that regulation, as referred to in paragraphs 40 and 43 above.

A23: In addition, as is clear from paragraphs 41 and 42 above, in order to ensure the effective and consistent application of the GDPR, the national supervisory authority must have genuine powers to take effectual action against infringements of that regulation.
A24: TRUE
A25: Accordingly, the corrective powers laid down in Article 58(2)(d) and (g) of the GDPR cannot be contingent on the origin of the data concerned and on whether, in particular, they were collected from the data subject.
