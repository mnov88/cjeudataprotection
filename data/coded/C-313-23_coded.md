A23: It should be recalled that every Member State must, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU, ensure that the bodies which are called upon, as 'courts or tribunals' within the meaning of EU law, to rule on questions relating to the application or interpretation of EU law and which thus come within its judicial system in the fields covered by EU law, meet the requirements of effective judicial protection, including that of independence.
A24: TRUE
A25: Since the prospect of opening a disciplinary investigation is, as such, liable to exert pressure on those who have the task of adjudicating in a dispute, it is essential that a body competent to conduct investigations and bring disciplinary proceedings should act objectively and impartially in the performance of its duties and, to that end, be free from any external influence.

A27: TRUE
A28: It is settled case-law of the Court that the guarantees of independence and impartiality required under EU law presuppose rules that are such as to dispel any reasonable doubt, in the minds of individuals, as to the imperviousness of the body in question to external factors and its neutrality with respect to the interests before it.

A14: TRUE
A15: Neither the fact that the information which is the subject of the national provisions relates to judges nor the fact that that information might have certain links with the performance of their duties is, in itself, such as to remove those national provisions from the scope of the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: That provision, read in the light of recital 16 of the GDPR, has the sole purpose of excluding from the scope of that regulation the processing of personal data carried out by State authorities in the course of an activity which is intended to safeguard national security or of an activity which can be classified in the same category.

A12: TRUE
A13: Under Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the concept of 'controller' covers natural or legal persons, public authorities, agencies or other bodies which, alone or jointly with others, determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: The protection of the data subjects would be undermined if point 7 of Article 4 of the GDPR were interpreted restrictively to cover only those cases in which the purposes and means of the data processing performed by a person, a public authority, an agency or a body are expressly determined by national law, even where those purposes and means are apparent, in essence, from the legal provisions governing the activity of the entity concerned.
A16: TRUE
A17: That provision seeks to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of 'controller', in accordance with the objective pursued by the GDPR, effective and complete protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.

A23: In order to establish whether a person or entity is to be classified as a controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR, it must therefore be examined whether that person or entity determines, alone or jointly with others, the purposes and means of the processing or whether those purposes and means are determined by national law.
A24: TRUE
A25: Having regard to the broad definition of the concept of 'controller' within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the determination of the purposes and means of the processing and, where appropriate, the nomination of that controller by national law may not only be explicit but also implicit.

A13: Article 51(1) of the GDPR requires Member States to provide for one or more independent public authorities which are to be responsible for monitoring the application of that regulation.

A15: Those authorities have the primary task, under Article 51(1) and (2) and Article 57(1)(a) and (g) of the GDPR, to monitor and enforce the application of that regulation, while contributing to its consistent application within the European Union, in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of such data within the European Union.
A16: TRUE
A17: The establishment of such authorities, which is also provided for by primary EU law, namely Article 8(3) of the Charter and Article 16(2) TFEU, is an essential component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.

A11: SECURITY
A12: TRUE
A13: Since the level of protection provided for by the GDPR is dependent on the security measures adopted by controllers of personal data, those controllers must be encouraged to do everything in their power to prevent the occurrence of processing operations that do not comply with that regulation, given that they bear the burden of demonstrating the appropriateness of those measures.
A14: TRUE
A15: Ensuring compliance with the requirements as regards security that are imposed by the GDPR is a matter, first, for the supervisory authorities, and second, the national courts hearing an action under Article 78(1) or under Article 79(1) of the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: It is of particular importance that the supervisory authorities have genuine powers to take effectual action against infringements of the GDPR, and in particular to bring them to an end, including in situations where data subjects have not been informed that their personal data have been processed, are not aware of it, or, in any event, have not lodged a complaint under Article 77(1) of the regulation.

A24: TRUE
A25: Those authorities must, like the national courts hearing an action under Article 78(1) or under Article 79(1) of the GDPR, make sure that the technical and organisational measures adopted by the controller are appropriate in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Article 32(1) of that regulation, while examining the substance of those measures in a concrete manner, in the light of all the criteria referred to in that article and the circumstances of the case and the evidence available to those authorities or courts in that regard.
