A13: At the outset, it should be noted that the GDPR does not define the terms 'dismissed', 'penalised' and 'for performing his [or her] tasks' featuring in the second sentence of Article 38(3).
A14: TRUE
A15: Thus, the second sentence of Article 38(3) of the GDPR, by protecting the data protection officer against any decision which terminates his or her duties, places him or her at a disadvantage or constitutes a penalty, where such a decision relates to the performance of his or her tasks, must be regarded as essentially seeking to preserve the functional independence of the data protection officer and, therefore, to ensure that the provisions of the GDPR are effective.
A16: TRUE
A17: In that regard, such independence must necessarily enable them to carry out those tasks in accordance with the objective of the GDPR, which seeks, inter alia, as is apparent from recital 10 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union.

A23: It follows that the second sentence of Article 38(3) of the GDPR is intended to apply to the relationship between a data protection officer and a controller or processor, irrespective of the nature of the employment relationship between that controller and the latter.
A24: TRUE
A25: As is clear from settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording, by considering the latter's usual meaning in everyday language, but also the context in which the provision occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part.

A27: TRUE
A28: It follows, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point 44 of his Opinion, that each Member State is free, in the exercise of its retained competence, to lay down more protective specific provisions on the termination of a data protection officer's employment contract, in so far as those provisions are compatible with EU law and, in particular, with the provisions of the GDPR, particularly the second sentence of Article 38(3) thereof.
