A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: According to settled case-law, the use of the expression 'any information' in the definition of the concept of 'personal data' in that provision reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it 'relates' to the data subject.

A13: Article 6(3) of the GDPR provides that the basis for the processing referred to in Article 6(1)(c) and (e) is to be defined, as the case may be, by EU or Member State law to which the controller is subject.
A14: TRUE
A15: That article must be read in the light, first, of recital 4 of the GDPR, which states, inter alia, that the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, second, of recital 154 of that regulation, from which it is apparent, inter alia, that public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such an obligation is such as to ensure lawful, fair and transparent processing in respect of that data subject, within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR, by allowing him or her to express his or her views on the proposed disclosure.

A22: TRUE
A23: Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR provides that processing may be lawful if and to the extent that it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
A24: TRUE
A25: Although, as is apparent from recital 10 of the GDPR, Member States have the power to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of that regulation, they must nevertheless use their discretion under the conditions and within the limits provided for by that regulation and must therefore legislate in such a way as not to undermine the content and objectives thereof.
