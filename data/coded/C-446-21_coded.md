A13: Article 5(1)(c) of that regulation, which enshrines the so-called 'data minimisation' principle, provides that personal data must be 'adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed'.
A14: TRUE

A16: TRUE
A17: As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that the objective pursued by the GDPR, as is set out in Article 1 thereof and in recitals 1 and 10 thereof, consists, inter alia, in ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, as enshrined in Article 8(1) of the Charter and Article 16(1) TFEU.

A25: As the Court has held previously, that principle gives expression to the principle of proportionality.

A27: TRUE
A28: In those circumstances, the processing of data at issue in the main proceedings is characterised by a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the data subjects, in particular their right to respect for their private life and the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

A10: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_CONDITIONS
A11: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_DEFINITION
A12: TRUE
A13: Under that provision, the prohibition of any processing of special categories of personal data, established in Article 9(1) thereof, does not apply in a scenario where the processing relates to personal data which are 'manifestly made public by the data subject'.
A14: TRUE
A15: Although Article 9(1) prohibits, as a matter of principle, the processing of data concerning, inter alia, sexual orientation, Article 9(2) provides, in points (a) to (j), for 10 derogations which are independent of each other and which must therefore be assessed independently.
A16: TRUE
A17: As the Court has held previously, that fundamental prohibition, laid down in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, is independent of whether or not the information revealed by the processing operation in question is correct and of whether the controller is acting with the aim of obtaining information that falls within one of the special categories referred to in that provision.

A24: TRUE
A25: In view of the significant risks to the fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights of data subjects arising from any processing of personal data falling within the categories referred to in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, the objective thereof is to prohibit such processing, irrespective of its stated purpose.
A26: C-136/17, C-252/21, C-667/21
A27: TRUE
A28: In so far as it provides for an exception to the principle that the processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited, Article 9(2) of the GDPR must be interpreted strictly.
