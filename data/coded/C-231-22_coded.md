A14: TRUE
A15: It is apparent from the clear wording of that provision that a controller may be not only a natural or legal person, but also a public authority, an agency or a body, and such entities do not necessarily have legal personality under national law.
A16: TRUE

A23: Having regard to the wording of point 7 of Article 4 of the GDPR, read in the light of that objective, it appears that, in order to establish whether a person or entity is to be classified as a 'controller' within the meaning of that provision, it must be examined whether that person or entity determines, alone or jointly with others, the purposes and means of the processing or whether those purposes and means are determined by national law.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, according to the case-law of the Court, that provision is intended to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of 'controller', effective and complete protection of data subjects.

A27: TRUE
A28: Moreover, it would be contrary to the objective of point 7 of Article 4 of the GDPR, referred to in paragraph 28 of the present judgment, to exclude the official journal of a Member State from the concept of 'controller' on the ground that it does not exercise control over the personal data contained in its publications.

A15: It is thus apparent from that provision that the respective responsibilities of joint controllers of personal data do not necessarily depend on the existence of an arrangement between the various controllers, but may stem from national law.
A16: TRUE
A17: In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, according to the case-law of the Court, that provision is intended to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of 'controller', effective and complete protection of data subjects.

A23: Therefore, the Moniteur belge must be considered to be responsible, under Article 5(2) of the GDPR, for compliance with the principles set out in paragraph 1 of that article, as regards the processing that it is required to perform under national law, and, accordingly, with all the obligations imposed on the controller by the GDPR.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has held, first, that it is sufficient that a person exerts influence over the processing of personal data, for his, her or its own purposes, and participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing in order for him, her or it to be regarded as a joint controller.
