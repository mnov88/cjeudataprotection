A9: 12, 15
A10: RIGHT_OF_ACCESS
A11: TRANSPARENCY
A12: TRUE
A13: It must be pointed out that neither the wording of Article 12(5) of the GDPR nor that of Article 15(1) and (3) thereof make the provision, free of charge, of a first copy of personal data conditional upon data subjects putting forward reasons to justify their requests.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 12 of the GDPR thus sets out the general obligations incumbent on the controller as regards the transparency of information and communications, as well as the rules governing the exercise of the rights of the data subject.
A16: TRUE
A17: Thirdly, regarding the objectives pursued by the GDPR, it should be noted that the purpose of that regulation, as indicated by recitals 10 and 11 thereof, is to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons within the Union, as well as to strengthen and set out in detail the rights of data subjects.

A23: It follows from a combined reading of Article 12(5) of the GDPR and Article 15(1) and (3) thereof that (i) the data subject has the right to obtain a first copy, free of charge, of his or her personal data undergoing processing and (ii) the controller is given the option, under certain conditions, to charge a reasonable fee taking administrative costs into account or to refuse to act on a request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
A24: TRUE
A25: As has already been held by the Court, it follows from the literal analysis of the first sentence of Article 15(3) of the GDPR that that provision confers on the data subject the right to obtain a faithful reproduction of his or her personal data, understood in a broad sense, that are subject to operations that can be classified as 'processing carried out by the controller'.

A7: National legislation cannot require data subjects to bear the costs of a first copy of personal data in order to protect the economic interests of controllers.

A9: 23, 12, 15
A10: MEMBER_STATE_DISCRETION
A11: RIGHT_OF_ACCESS
A12: TRUE
A13: Indeed, Article 23(1) of the GDPR merely indicates that a legislative measure of a Member State may restrict the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles 12 to 22 of that regulation in so far as that measure corresponds to the rights and obligations provided for in those articles and when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure to safeguard, inter alia, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
A14: TRUE
A15: Similarly, Article 23(1)(i) of that regulation recalls that a restriction of the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in, inter alia, Article 15 thereof is possible 'when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard … the protection of … the rights and freedoms of others'.
A16: TRUE
A17: In those circumstances, the pursuit of the objective connected with the protection of the economic interests of persons providing treatment cannot justify a measure leading to the undermining of the right to obtain, free of charge, a first copy and, as a result, of the effectiveness of the data subject's right of access to his or her personal data undergoing processing.

A22: TRUE
A23: Consequently, Article 23(1) of the GDPR does not exclude from its scope national legislative measures adopted prior to the entry into force of that regulation in so far as those measures satisfy the conditions laid down in that provision.
A24: TRUE
A25: Pursuant to recital 4 of that regulation, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right and must be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
A26: C-175/20
A27: TRUE
A28: Thus, the GDPR respects all the fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as enshrined by the Treaties.
A29: MIXED
A30: TRUE
A31: While Article 23(1)(i) textually allows restrictions for protecting rights of others, the Court shifted to effectiveness principle to conclude economic interests cannot justify undermining access rights.
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Limits Member State discretion to restrict right of access and rejects economic interests of controllers as valid justification.
A34: TRUE
A35: REGULAR
A36: The Court assessed whether charging for first copies is a necessary and proportionate measure; concluded protecting economic interests cannot justify undermining the effectiveness of access rights.
A37: TRUE
A38: DATA_SUBJECT
A39: The economic interest of controllers in being relieved of costs cannot override the data subject's right to a first free copy of personal data.
A40: TRUE
A41: freedom to conduct a business
A42: DATA_PROTECTION
A43: Data protection right to free first copy prevails over the controller's economic interests and freedom to conduct business.

A11: TRANSPARENCY

A13: Next, the first sentence of Article 15(3) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as establishing a separate right from that provided for in Article 15(1) thereof.
A14: TRUE
A15: Furthermore, the term 'copy' does not relate to a document as such, but to the personal data which it contains and which must be complete.
A16: TRUE
A17: Lastly, regarding the objectives pursued by Article 15 of the GDPR, the purpose of that regulation is to strengthen and set out in detail the rights of data subjects.
