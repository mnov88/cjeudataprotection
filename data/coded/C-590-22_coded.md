A7: A GDPR infringement alone does not confer a right to compensation; the data subject must prove actual damage, though no severity threshold applies.
A8: Article 82(1)
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 82(1) GDPR provides that 'any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered'.
A14: TRUE
A15: Moreover, the separate reference to 'damage' and to an 'infringement' in Article 82(1) of the GDPR would be superfluous if the EU legislature had considered that an infringement of the provisions of that regulation could be sufficient, by itself and in any event, to give rise to a right to compensation.
A16: TRUE
A17: The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION
A19: NULL
A20: SEMANTIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows from the wording of that provision that the existence of 'damage', whether material or non-material, which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article 82(1), as does the existence of an infringement of that regulation and of a causal link between that damage and that infringement, those three conditions being cumulative.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has already held that it is clear from the wording of that provision that the existence of 'damage', whether material or non-material, which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article 82(1).

A7: Fear of personal data disclosure to third parties can constitute compensable non-material damage if the fear and its negative consequences are duly proven.
A8: Article 82(1)
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: In the absence of any reference in Article 82(1) of the GDPR to the domestic law of the Member States, the concept of 'non-material damage', within the meaning of that provision, must be given an autonomous and uniform definition specific to EU law.
A14: FALSE
A15: NULL
A16: TRUE
A17: The Court has held that it is apparent not only from the wording of Article 82(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recitals 85 and 146 of that regulation, which encourage the acceptance of a broad interpretation of the concept of 'non-material damage' within the meaning of that first provision, but also the objective of ensuring a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data.

A7: Article 83 administrative fine criteria do not apply to compensation assessment, and Article 82 compensation has no dissuasive or punitive function.
A8: Article 82(1), Article 83
A9: 82, 83
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: ADMINISTRATIVE_FINES
A12: TRUE
A13: While Article 83 of that regulation determines the 'general conditions for imposing administrative fines', Article 82 of that regulation governs the 'right to compensation and liability'.
A14: TRUE
A15: Thus, in the light of the differences in wording and purpose existing between Article 82 of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 146 thereof, and Article 83 of that regulation, read in the light of recital 148 thereof, it cannot be found that the assessment criteria specifically set out in Article 83 are applicable mutatis mutandis in the context of Article 82.
A16: TRUE
A17: In view of the compensatory function of the right to compensation under Article 82 of the GDPR, as set out in the sixth sentence of recital 146 of that regulation, financial compensation based on that article must be regarded as 'full and effective' if it allows the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in its entirety.
A18: EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows that the criteria set out in Article 83 of the GDPR for the purposes of determining the amount of administrative fines, which are also mentioned in recital 148 of that regulation, cannot be used to assess the amount of damages under Article 82 thereof.
A24: TRUE
A25: The right to compensation provided for in Article 82(1) of the GDPR does not fulfil a dissuasive, or even punitive, function.

A7: Simultaneous infringements of national data protection provisions not specifying GDPR rules are irrelevant for determining compensation under Article 82(1).
A8: Article 82(1)
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: MEMBER_STATE_DISCRETION
A12: TRUE
A13: However, the fact that such data processing was also carried out in breach of provisions of national law relating to the protection of personal data but not intended to specify the rules of that regulation, is not a relevant factor for the purposes of assessing the damages awarded on the basis of Article 82(1) of the GDPR.
A14: TRUE
A15: The infringement of such national provisions is not covered by Article 82(1) of that regulation, read in conjunction with recital 146 thereof.
A16: FALSE
A17: NULL
A18: NULL
A19: NULL
A20: SEMANTIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It is indeed apparent, in essence, from the fifth sentence of recital 146 of the GDPR that processing of personal data carried out in breach of that regulation 'also includes processing that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation'.
