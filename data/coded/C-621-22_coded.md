A7: Commercial interests can constitute legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, but processing must be strictly necessary and fundamental rights must not override the legitimate interest.

A12: TRUE
A13: While the concept of 'legitimate interest', within the meaning of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, is not limited to interests enshrined in and determined by law, it requires that the alleged legitimate interest be lawful.
A14: TRUE
A15: In that context, it should also be recalled that the condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the 'data minimisation' principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, in accordance with which personal data must be 'adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed'.
A16: TRUE
A17: In order to answer those questions, it should, as a preliminary point, be borne in mind that the objective pursued by the GDPR, as is set out in Article 1 thereof and in recitals 1 and 10 thereof, consists, inter alia, in ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, as enshrined in Article 8(1) of the Charter and Article 16(1) TFEU.

A22: TRUE
A23: As the Court has previously held, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data is lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and, third, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has held, the protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life.
