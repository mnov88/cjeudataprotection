A23: It follows, as the Advocate General observed in point 33 of his Opinion, that Article 15(1) of the GDPR confers on data subjects a procedural right consisting of obtaining information about the processing of their personal data.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, it must be borne in mind that procedural rules are generally taken to apply from the date on which they enter into force, as opposed to substantive rules, which are usually interpreted as applying to situations that have arisen and become definitive before their entry into force only in so far as it follows clearly from their terms, their objectives or their general scheme that such an effect must be given to them.

A10: RIGHT_OF_ACCESS
A11: PERSONAL_DATA_SCOPE, RECIPIENT_DEFINITION
A12: TRUE
A13: The use of the expression 'any information' in the definition of the concept of 'personal data' in that provision reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it 'relates' to the data subject.

A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, the Court has held that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller information about the specific recipients to whom the personal data concerning him or her have been or will be disclosed.
A26: C-154/21, C-487/21, C-311/18
A27: TRUE
A28: Under recital 4 of the GDPR, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, since it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights.
A29: MIXED
A30: TRUE
A31: Text of Article 15(1) implied broad access to log data including employee identities, but Court shifted to balancing principle to limit disclosure of employee identities unless essential.

A16: TRUE
A17: As regards, secondly, the fact that J.M. was both a customer and an employee of Pankki S, it should be noted that, having regard not only to the objectives of the GDPR but also to the scope of the data subject's right of access, as recalled in paragraphs 49 and 55 to 59 above, the context in which that data subject requests access to the information referred to in Article 15(1) of the GDPR cannot have any influence on the scope of that right.
