A13: That provision provides that, without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial remedy, each natural or legal person is to have the right to an effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a supervisory authority concerning them.
A14: TRUE
A15: It is important to note that, in accordance with Article 8(3) of the Charter and Article 51(1) and Article 57(1)(a) of the GDPR, the national supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with the EU rules concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
A16: TRUE
A17: If Article 78(1) of that regulation were to be interpreted as meaning that the judicial review referred to therein is limited to verifying whether the supervisory authority has handled the complaint, investigated the subject matter of the complaint to the extent appropriate and informed the complainant of the outcome of the investigation, the attainment of the objectives and the pursuit of the purpose of the regulation would necessarily be compromised.

A23: It follows from Article 78(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 143 of that regulation, that courts seised of an action against a decision of a supervisory authority should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them.
A24: TRUE
A25: Thus, the Court has already held that it follows from Article 78(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 143 of that regulation, that courts seised of an action against a decision of a supervisory authority should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them.
A26: C-132/21, C-311/18

A13: Under that provision, the processing of personal data is lawful only if and to the extent that it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: In that context, it should also be recalled that the condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the 'data minimisation' principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, in accordance with which personal data must be 'adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed'.
A16: TRUE
A17: Moreover, as the Advocate General observed in point 75 of his Opinion, the discharge from remaining debts is intended to allow the person who benefits from it to re-enter economic life and is therefore generally of existential importance to that person.

A23: Accordingly, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions for the processing of personal data to be lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the interests or freedoms and fundamental rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence.
A24: TRUE
A25: As regards point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, the Court has held that that provision must be interpreted as meaning that processing can be regarded as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, within the meaning of that provision, only if such processing is carried out in so far as is strictly necessary for the purposes of that legitimate interest.
A26: C-252/21, C-13/16, C-77/21, C-131/12

A33: Limits credit agency data retention to public register period, restricting controller processing and prioritizing data subject rehabilitation interests.
A34: TRUE
A35: STRICT
A36: Processing must be strictly necessary for the legitimate interest; the Court required that legitimate interests cannot reasonably be achieved by less restrictive means, concluding credit sector interests do not justify retention beyond public register period.
A37: TRUE
A38: DATA_SUBJECT
A39: Data subject's right to re-enter economic life after insolvency discharge overrides credit sector interest in extended data retention.
A40: TRUE

A12: TRUE
A13: That provision establishes the right to erasure of personal data where the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no 'overriding legitimate grounds for the processing'.
A14: TRUE
A15: It follows from a combined reading of those provisions that the data subject enjoys a right to object to processing and a right to erasure, unless there are overriding legitimate grounds which take precedence over the interests and rights and freedoms of that person within the meaning of Article 21(1) of the GDPR, which it is for the controller to demonstrate.
