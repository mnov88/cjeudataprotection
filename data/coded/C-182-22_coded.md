A12: TRUE
A13: Accordingly, Article 82(1) of the GDPR has been interpreted as meaning that the right to compensation laid down in that provision, in particular in the case of non-material damage, fulfils an exclusively compensatory function, in that financial compensation based on that provision must allow the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in full, and not a deterrent or punitive function.
A14: TRUE
A15: The relationship between the rules set out in Article 82 and those set out in Articles 83 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: The right of any person to seek compensation for damage reinforces the operational nature of the protection rules laid down by that regulation and is likely to discourage the reoccurrence of unlawful conduct.

A14: TRUE
A15: Recitals 75 and 85 of the GDPR set out various circumstances that could be classified as 'physical, material or non-material damage' without establishing a hierarchy between them nor do they indicate that harm resulting from a data breach is, by its very nature, less significant than physical injury.
A16: TRUE
A17: Assuming, as a matter of principle, that physical injury is, by its nature, more serious than non-material damage, would risk calling into question the principle of full and effective compensation for the damage suffered.
