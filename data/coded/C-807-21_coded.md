A7: National law cannot require that a GDPR infringement be attributed to an identified natural person before imposing an administrative fine on a legal person controller.
A8: Article 4(7), Article 58(2)(i), Article 83(1) to (6)
A9: 4, 58, 83
A10: ADMINISTRATIVE_FINES
A11: CONTROLLER_DEFINITION
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines the concept of 'controller' broadly, as referring to the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: It thus follows from a combined reading of Article 4(7), Article 83 and Article 58(2)(i) of the GDPR that an administrative fine in respect of an infringement referred to in Article 83(4) to (6) may also be imposed on legal persons where they are controllers.
A16: TRUE
A17: The objective of that broad definition in Article 4(7) of the GDPR – which expressly includes legal persons – is, in a manner consistent with the objective of the GDPR, to ensure effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, to ensure a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It is apparent from Article 83(4) to (6) of the GDPR, which concerns the calculation of administrative fines in respect of the infringements listed in those paragraphs, that, where the addressee of the administrative fine is or forms part of an undertaking, within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the maximum amount of the administrative fine is calculated on the basis of a percentage of the total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding business year of the undertaking concerned.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has previously held that a natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of personal data, for his own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller.
A26: C-40/17, C-319/20, C-25/17, C-539/10 P, C-550/10 P, C-882/19
A27: TRUE
A28: To allow Member States to make it a requirement, unilaterally and as a necessary condition for the imposition of an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR on a controller who is a legal person, that the infringement in question is first attributed or attributable to an identified natural person, would be contrary to that purpose of the GDPR.
A29: RULE_BASED
A30: TRUE
A31: Text of Article 4(7) defines controller broadly including legal persons; Court shifts to effectiveness and harmonization purposes to reject Member State requirements that undermine direct liability of legal persons.
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Holding ensures effective enforcement by allowing direct fines on legal person controllers without requiring attribution to a natural person.

A9: 83
A10: ADMINISTRATIVE_FINES
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Accordingly, it follows from the wording of Article 83(2) of the GDPR that only infringements of the provisions of that regulation committed wrongfully by the controller, that is to say those committed intentionally or negligently, can result in a fine being imposed on the controller pursuant to that article.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 83(2) of the GDPR must be read in conjunction with Article 83(3) thereof, the purpose of which is to lay down the consequences of cumulative infringements of that regulation, according to which 'if a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement'.
A16: TRUE
A17: Through their deterrent effect, administrative fines contribute to strengthening the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and therefore constitute a key element in ensuring respect for the rights of those persons, in accordance with the purpose of that regulation of ensuring a high level of protection of such persons with regard to the processing of personal data.

A23: Those factors include, in Article 83(2)(b) thereof, 'the intentional or negligent character of the infringement'.
A24: TRUE
A25: A controller can be penalised for conduct falling within the scope of the GDPR where that controller could not be unaware of the infringing nature of its conduct, whether or not it is aware that it is infringing the provisions of the GDPR.
