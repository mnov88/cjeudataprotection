A7: A TC String encoding user consent preferences constitutes personal data when it can be associated by reasonable means with identifiers allowing user identification.

A10: PERSONAL_DATA_SCOPE
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 4(1) of the GDPR states that personal data is 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person', and specifies that 'an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person'.
A14: TRUE
A15: It follows from Article 4(5) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital 26 of that regulation, that personal data which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information must be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person.
A16: TRUE
A17: The use of the expression 'any information' in the definition of the concept of 'personal data' in that provision reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it 'relates to' the data subject.

A23: As is clear from the wording of Article 4(1) of the GDPR that an identifiable person is one who can be identified not only directly, but also indirectly.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, the use by the EU legislature of the word 'indirectly' suggests that, in order to treat information as personal data, it is not necessary that that information alone allows the data subject to be identified.

A7: A sectoral organization establishing binding technical rules for consent management is a joint controller even without direct data access, but controllership does not automatically extend to subsequent third-party processing.

A9: 4, 26
A10: JOINT_CONTROLLERS_DEFINITION
A11: CONTROLLER_DEFINITION
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines broadly the concept of 'controller' as referring to the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: Since, as Article 4(7) of the GDPR expressly provides, the concept of 'controller' relates to the entity which 'alone or jointly with others' determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, that concept does not necessarily refer to a single entity and may concern several actors taking part in that processing, with each of them then being subject to the applicable data protection provisions.
A16: TRUE
A17: The objective pursued by the GDPR, as is set out in Article 1 thereof and in recitals 1 and 10 thereof, consists, inter alia, in ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, as enshrined in Article 8(1) of the Charter and Article 16(1) TFEU.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows from Article 4(7) and Article 26(1) of the GDPR that a natural or legal person may be regarded as a joint controller in respect of personal data processing operations only where that person jointly determines the purposes and means of such operations.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has previously held, the objective of that provision is to ensure, through that broad definition of the concept of 'controller', effective and complete protection of data subjects.
A26: C-210/16, C-25/17, C-683/21, C-40/17, C-60/22
A27: TRUE
A28: A natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of personal data, for his, her or its own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR.
A29: CASE_LAW_BASED

A33: Broad joint controller interpretation extends accountability but limits do not automatically extend to subsequent processing, balancing controller burden.
