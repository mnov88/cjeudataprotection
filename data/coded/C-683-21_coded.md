A7: An entity commissioning a mobile app may be a controller if it participated in determining processing purposes and means, even without performing processing operations itself.
A8: Article 4(7)
A9: 4
A10: CONTROLLER_DEFINITION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines the concept of 'controller' broadly as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which, alone or jointly with others, 'determines the purposes and means of the processing' of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: It is apparent from that provision, read in the light of recital 74 of the GDPR, that an entity, provided that it satisfies the condition laid down by Article 4(7) of that regulation, is responsible and liable not only for any processing of personal data which it itself carries out, but also for any such processing carried out on its behalf.
A16: TRUE
A17: The objective of that broad definition consists, in accordance with the objective pursued by the GDPR, in ensuring effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, in ensuring a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: In order to establish whether an entity such as the NVSC may be regarded as a controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR, it is necessary to examine whether that entity actually exerted influence, for its own purposes, over the determination of the purposes and means of the processing in question.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has already held that any natural or legal person who exerts influence over the processing of such data, for his, her or its own purposes, and who participates, as a result, in the determination of the purposes and means of that processing, may be regarded as a controller in respect of such processing.

A7: Joint controller classification does not require a formal arrangement between entities regarding purposes, means, or terms of joint control.
A8: Article 4(7), Article 26(1)
A9: 4, 26
A10: JOINT_CONTROLLERS_DEFINITION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Under Article 26(1) of the GDPR, 'joint controllers' exist where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing.
A14: TRUE
A15: However, the existence of such an arrangement constitutes not a precondition for two or more entities to be classified as joint controllers, but rather an obligation which Article 26(1) of the GDPR imposes on joint controllers, once they have been classified as such, for the purposes of compliance with their obligations under that regulation.
A16: FALSE
A17: NULL

A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Thus, such classification arises solely from the fact that several entities have participated in the determination of the purposes and means of processing.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has held, in order to be regarded as a joint controller, a natural or legal person therefore must independently meet the definition of 'controller' laid down in Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

A7: Using personal data for IT testing constitutes processing unless the data are anonymous, anonymized, or fictitious relating to non-existent persons.
A8: Article 4(2), Article 4(1), Article 4(5)
A9: 4
A10: PERSONAL_DATA_SCOPE
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: It is therefore apparent from the wording of that provision, and in particular from the expression 'any operation', that the EU legislature intended to confer a broad scope upon the concept of 'processing'.
A14: TRUE
A15: It follows from recital 26 of the GDPR and from the very definition of the concept of 'personal data' provided in Article 4(1) of that regulation that neither 'anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person', nor 'personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable', is covered by that concept.
A16: FALSE
A17: NULL
A18: NULL
A19: NULL
A20: SEMANTIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Consequently, the question whether personal data are used for the purposes of IT testing or for another purpose has no bearing on whether the operation in question is classified as 'processing' within the meaning of that provision.
A24: TRUE
A25: It is therefore apparent from the wording of that provision, and in particular from the expression 'any operation', that the EU legislature intended to confer a broad scope upon the concept of 'processing'.

A7: Administrative fines require intentional or negligent infringement; controllers may be fined for processor operations unless processor acted outside the agreed framework.
A8: Article 83, Article 4(8), Article 28(10), Article 58(2), Article 84
A9: 83, 4, 28, 58, 84
A10: ADMINISTRATIVE_FINES
A11: PROCESSOR_OBLIGATIONS
A12: TRUE
A13: As regards, in the first place, the question whether an administrative fine may be imposed pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR only in so far as it is established that the controller or processor has intentionally or negligently committed an infringement referred to in paragraphs 4 to 6 of that article, it is apparent from paragraph 1 thereof that such fines must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
A14: TRUE
A15: It thus follows from such a combined reading of those provisions that the determination of substantive conditions for imposing such administrative fines falls outside the scope of that power.
A16: TRUE
A17: Through their dissuasive effect, administrative fines contribute to strengthening the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and are therefore a key element in ensuring respect for the rights of those persons, in accordance with the purpose of that regulation, which is to ensure a high level of protection for such persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, HARMONIZATION, EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It thus follows from the wording of Article 83(2) of the GDPR that only infringements of the provisions of that regulation which are committed wrongfully by the controller, that is to say, those committed intentionally or negligently, may result in an administrative fine being imposed on that controller pursuant to that article.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, it must also be stated, in relation to the question whether an infringement has been committed intentionally or negligently and is therefore liable to be penalised by way of an administrative fine under Article 83 of the GDPR, that a controller may be penalised for conduct falling within the scope of the GDPR where that controller could not have been unaware of the infringing nature of its conduct, whether or not it was aware that it was infringing the provisions of the GDPR.

A27: TRUE
A28: However, the EU legislature did not deem it necessary, for the purpose of ensuring such a high level of protection, to provide for the imposition of administrative fines in the absence of fault.
A29: MIXED
A30: FALSE
A31: NULL
A32: MIXED
A33: Requires fault for fines (pro-controller) but allows controller liability for processor actions within agreed scope (pro-data subject).
