A12: TRUE
A13: It is clear from the wording of that provision that the existence of 'damage' which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in that provision, as does the existence of an infringement of the GDPR and of a causal link between that damage and that infringement, those three conditions being cumulative.
A14: TRUE
A15: The relationship between the rules set out in Article 82 and those set out in Articles 83 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR.

A24: TRUE
A25: It should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union.

A11: NULL
A12: TRUE

A14: TRUE
A15: The third sentence of recital 146 of the GDPR states that 'the concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation'.

A15: In the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights of individuals, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy.
A16: TRUE
A17: In that regard, in view of the compensatory function of the right to compensation under Article 82 of the GDPR, as the Advocate General pointed out, in essence, in points 39, 49 and 52 of his Opinion, financial compensation based on that provision must be regarded as 'full and effective' if it allows the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in its entirety, without there being any need, for the purposes of such compensation for the damage in its entirety, to require the payment of punitive damages.

A24: TRUE
A25: It should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, in the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights of individuals.
