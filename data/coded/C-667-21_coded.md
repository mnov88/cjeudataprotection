A7: The Article 9(2)(h) exception applies when a medical service processes health data of its own employee to assess working capacity, provided it acts as medical service not employer.

A14: TRUE
A15: It follows from Article 9(2)(h) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 9(3), that the possibility of processing sensitive data, such as data concerning health, is strictly regulated by a series of cumulative conditions.
A16: TRUE
A17: Thus, recital 4 of the GDPR states that the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, since it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has clarified that the purpose of Article 9(1) of that regulation is to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

A7: Article 9(3) does not require controllers to prevent all colleagues from accessing employee health data, though Member State law or security principles may impose such obligations.

A13: Personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to in point (h) of paragraph 2 when those data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law.
A14: TRUE
A15: By adopting Article 9(3) of that regulation, which refers specifically to Article 9(2)(h) of that article, the EU legislature defined the specific protection measures it intended to impose on controllers of such processing, which consist in such processing being reserved to persons subject to an obligation of secrecy.

A23: It follows, as the Advocate General points out in essence in point 43 of his Opinion, that Article 9(3) of the GDPR cannot serve as a legal basis for a measure guaranteeing that no colleague of the data subject may have access to data relating to the data subject's state of health.
A24: TRUE
A25: It has already been held that, in so far as Articles 7 to 11 of the GDPR, which appear, like Articles 5 and 6 thereof, in Chapter II of that regulation, are intended to clarify the scope of the data controller's obligations under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) of that regulation.

A9: 9, 6, 5
A10: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_CONDITIONS

A12: TRUE
A13: In addition, it should be noted that recital 51 of the GDPR expressly states that, 'in addition to the specific requirements' for the processing of 'particularly sensitive' data, which are set out in Article 9(2) and (3) of that regulation, 'the general principles and other rules of [that] Regulation should [also] apply [to such processing], in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing'.
A14: TRUE
A15: It should be recalled that Articles 5, 6 and 9 of the GDPR are in Chapter II of that regulation, entitled 'Principles', and concern principles relating to processing of personal data, conditions for the lawfulness of processing and processing of special categories of personal data, respectively.
A16: FALSE

A23: Therefore, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, processing of 'particularly sensitive' data, such as data concerning health, is lawful only if at least one of the conditions set out in points (a) to (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) is satisfied.
A24: TRUE
A25: Therefore, the Court has repeatedly held that any processing of personal data must comply with the principles relating to the processing of data which are set out in Article 5(1) of the GDPR and satisfy the conditions governing lawfulness of the processing which are listed in Article 6 of that regulation.

A12: TRUE
A13: Article 82(1) of the GDPR states that 'any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered'.
A14: TRUE
A15: The relationship between the rules set out in Article 82 and those set out in Articles 83 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: In that regard, first, it is apparent from the wording of Articles 24 and 32 of the GDPR that those provisions merely require the controller to adopt technical and organisational measures intended to avoid, in so far as it is at all possible, any personal data breach.
A18: EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Financial compensation based on that article must be regarded as 'full and effective' if it allows the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in its entirety, without there being any need, for the purposes of such compensation for the damage in its entirety, to require the payment of punitive damages.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has interpreted that provision as meaning that a mere infringement of the GDPR is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation, after pointing out, inter alia, that the existence of 'damage' which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article 82(1).

A7: Controller liability under Article 82 requires fault, which is presumed but rebuttable; fault severity does not affect damages amount.
A8: Article 82, Article 82(1), Article 82(2), Article 82(3), Article 24, Article 32
A9: 82, 24, 32
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: ACCOUNTABILITY
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 82(3) of the GDPR specifies, from that perspective, that a controller is exempt from liability under Article 82(2) of that regulation if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
A14: TRUE
A15: It therefore follows from a combined analysis of those various provisions of Article 82 of the GDPR that that article provides for fault-based liability in which the burden of proof rests not on the person who has suffered damage, but on the controller.
A16: TRUE
A17: With regard to the objectives of the GDPR, it is clear from recitals 4 to 8 of that regulation that it seeks to strike a balance between the interests of controllers of personal data and the rights of data subjects whose personal data are processed.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Article 82(2) of the GDPR provides that any controller involved in processing is to be liable for the damage caused by processing which infringes that regulation.
A24: TRUE
A25: First, as the Advocate General observes, in essence, in point 93 of his Opinion, it would not be consistent with the objective of such a high level of protection to opt for an interpretation according to which data subjects who have suffered damage as a result of an infringement of the GDPR should, in an action for damages under Article 82 of that regulation, bear the burden of proving not only the existence of that infringement and the damage resulting therefrom for them, but also the existence of a fault on the part of the controller.
