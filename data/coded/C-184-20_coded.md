A13: Under Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 and point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, which are mentioned by the referring court in its first question, processing that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller is lawful.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 6(3) of the GDPR specifies, in respect of those two situations where processing is lawful, that the processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject, and that that legal basis must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
A16: TRUE
A17: In accordance with Article 1(1) of Directive 95/46, read in conjunction with recital 10 thereof, and Article 1(2) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recitals 4 and 10 thereof, that directive and that regulation have the objective in particular of ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with respect to the processing of personal data.

A22: TRUE
A23: Article 7 of Directive 95/46 and the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR set out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society and be weighed against other fundamental rights.
A26: C-314/96, C-67/20 to C-69/20, C-160/20, C-439/19, C-175/20, C-398/15, C-230/14, C-494/12, C-708/18, C-140/20, C-507/17, C-131/12
A27: TRUE
A28: It must be borne in mind that an objective of general interest may not be pursued without having regard to the fact that it must be reconciled with the fundamental rights affected by the measure, by properly balancing the objective of general interest against the rights at issue.
A29: PRINCIPLE_BASED
A30: TRUE
A31: Text allowed Member States to establish legal bases for processing, but Court shifted to proportionality principle to conclude that blanket online publication disproportionately interferes with fundamental rights.
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Court restricts scope of permissible online publication of personal data, requiring proportionality assessment that favors privacy over transparency.
A34: TRUE
A35: STRICT

A37: TRUE

A7: Personal data liable to indirectly reveal sexual orientation constitutes processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9(1) GDPR.

A9: 9
A10: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_DEFINITION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46 states that Member States are to prohibit the processing of personal data 'revealing' racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the processing of data 'concerning' health or sex life.
A14: TRUE
A15: Such an interpretation, which would result in a distinction being drawn according to the type of sensitive data at issue, would not, however, be consistent with a contextual analysis of those provisions, in particular with Article 4(15) of the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: Furthermore, a wide interpretation of the terms 'special categories of personal data' and 'sensitive data' is confirmed by the objective of Directive 95/46 and the GDPR, noted in paragraph 61 of the present judgment, which is to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular of their private life, with respect to the processing of personal data concerning them.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, FUNDAMENTAL_RIGHTS
A19: NULL
A20: TELEOLOGICAL
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article 9(1) of the GDPR provide for the prohibition, inter alia, of processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.
A24: TRUE
A25: The contrary interpretation would, moreover, run counter to the purpose of Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article 9(1) of the GDPR, namely to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is liable to constitute, as follows from recital 33 of Directive 95/46 and recital 51 of the GDPR, a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights.
A26: C-124/20, C-101/01, C-136/17
A27: TRUE
A28: Consequently, those provisions cannot be interpreted as meaning that the processing of personal data that are liable indirectly to reveal sensitive information concerning a natural person is excluded from the strengthened protection regime prescribed by those provisions, if the effectiveness of that regime and the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons that it is intended to ensure are not to be compromised.
A29: MIXED

A31: NULL
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Broad interpretation of special categories to include indirect revelation of sensitive data expands protection for data subjects.
