A13: Article 82(1) of the GDPR provides that any person 'who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered'.
A14: TRUE
A15: However, that provision merely confers a right to bring an action on a person who considers himself or herself to be a victim of a breach of the rights conferred on him or her by the GDPR, without exempting that person from his or her obligation under Article 82(1) of that regulation to prove that he or she has actually suffered material or non-material damage.
A16: TRUE
A17: In that regard, it should be noted that recital 85 of the GDPR expressly mentions 'loss of control' among the damage that may be caused by a personal data breach.

A23: The Court has already interpreted Article 82(1) of the GDPR as meaning that the mere infringement of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation, since the existence of 'damage', material or non-material, or of 'damage' which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article 82(1).
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has already held that the loss of control over such data, even for a short period of time, may constitute 'non-material damage', within the meaning of Article 82(1) of that regulation, giving rise to a right to compensation, provided that the data subject can show that he or she has actually suffered such damage, however slight.

A12: TRUE
A13: Article 32(4) of the GDPR, relating to the security of processing of personal data, provides that the controller is to take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller, who has access to such data, does not process them, except on instructions from the controller.
A14: TRUE
A15: An employee of the controller is indeed a natural person acting under the authority of that controller.
A16: TRUE
A17: If it were accepted that the controller may be exempted from liability merely by relying on the failure of a person acting under his or her authority, that would undermine the effectiveness of the right to compensation enshrined in Article 82(1) of the GDPR and would not be consistent with the objective of that regulation, which is to ensure a high level of protection for individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data.

A23: It is apparent from Article 82(2) and (3) that that article provides for a fault-based regime, in which the controller is presumed to have participated in the processing constituting the breach of the GDPR in question, so that the burden of proof lies not with the person who has suffered damage but with the controller.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has already held that it is apparent from a combined analysis of Article 82(2) and (3) that that article provides for a fault-based regime, in which the controller is presumed to have participated in the processing constituting the breach of the GDPR in question.

A7: Administrative fine criteria under Article 83 do not apply to compensation assessment, and multiple infringements do not increase damages beyond actual harm suffered.

A9: 82, 83
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: ADMINISTRATIVE_FINES
A12: TRUE
A13: While Article 83 of that regulation determines the 'general conditions for imposing administrative fines', Article 82 of that regulation governs the 'right to compensation and liability'.
A14: TRUE
A15: The relationship between the rules set out in Article 82 and those set out in Articles 83 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: Referring to the sixth sentence of recital 146 of the GDPR, according to which that instrument is intended to ensure 'full and effective compensation for the damage … suffered', the Court noted that, in view of the compensatory function of the right to compensation provided for in Article 82 of that regulation, monetary compensation based on that article must be regarded as 'full and effective' if it allows the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in its entirety.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows that the criteria set out in Article 83 of the GDPR for the purposes of determining the amount of administrative fines, which are also mentioned in recital 148 of that regulation, cannot be used to assess the amount of damages under Article 82 thereof.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court emphasised that Article 82 of the GDPR has a function that is compensatory and not punitive, contrary to other provisions of that regulation also contained in Chapter VIII thereof, namely Articles 83 and 84, which have, for their part, essentially a punitive purpose.
