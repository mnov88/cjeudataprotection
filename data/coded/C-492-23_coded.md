A7: Online marketplace operators must identify advertisements containing sensitive data, verify advertiser identity, and refuse publication absent explicit consent from the data subject.
A8: Article 4(7), Article 5(2), Article 9(1), Article 9(2)(a), Article 24, Article 25, Article 26

A10: JOINT_CONTROLLERS_DEFINITION
A11: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_CONDITIONS, ACCOUNTABILITY
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines the concept of 'controller' broadly as meaning the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 26 of the GDPR, which forms part of the framework for defining the 'controller' referred to in Article 4(7) of that regulation, provides, in essence, that, where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of the processing, they must be classified as 'joint controllers' of that processing.
A16: TRUE
A17: The objective of that broad definition consists, in accordance with the objective pursued by the GDPR, in ensuring effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in ensuring a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, FUNDAMENTAL_RIGHTS

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows that both that operator and that user advertiser are required to ensure compliance with the obligations arising from Article 5(2) and Articles 24 and 25 of the GDPR.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has clarified that the purpose of Article 9(1) of that regulation is to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter.
A26: C-667/21, C-204/21, C-184/20, C-683/21, C-40/17, C-25/17, C-210/16, C-460/20, C-60/22, C-687/21, C-394/23, C-129/21, C-21/23
A27: TRUE
A28: Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to those fundamental rights and freedoms.

A7: Online marketplace operators must implement security measures to prevent sensitive data advertisements from being copied and unlawfully published on other websites.

A9: 4, 9, 24, 32
A10: SECURITY
A11: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_CONDITIONS
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 32(1) of the GDPR provides that, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
A14: TRUE
A15: It should also be observed that the fourth question essentially concerns the scope of the security obligation with which a controller of personal data must comply.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such enhanced protection necessarily calls for a broad definition of such 'sensitive data'.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, FUNDAMENTAL_RIGHTS
A19: NULL
A20: RULE_BASED
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Thus, it is apparent from the wording of Article 32 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 24 of that regulation, that Article 32 merely requires the controller to adopt technical and organisational measures intended to avoid, in so far as it is at all possible, any personal data breach.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has held that the reference in Article 32(1) and (2) of the GDPR to 'a level of security appropriate to the risk' and to an 'appropriate level of security' shows that that regulation establishes a risk management system and that it in no way purports to eliminate the risks of personal data breaches.
A26: C-340/21, C-667/21
A27: TRUE
A28: The enhanced protection, provided for in Article 9(1) of the GDPR for certain categories of data, because of their particular sensitivity, is based on the fact that the processing of such data is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter.
A29: RULE_BASED

A7: Online marketplace operators cannot rely on e-Commerce Directive liability exemptions for infringements of their GDPR obligations regarding personal data processing.
A8: Article 1(5)(b) Directive 2000/31, Article 2(4) GDPR, Article 4(7), Article 5(2), Articles 24-26, Article 32
A9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 24, 25, 26, 32
A10: OTHER_CONTROLLER_OBLIGATIONS
A11: ACCOUNTABILITY
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 1(5)(b) of Directive 2000/31 states that that directive is not to apply to questions relating to information society services covered by Directives 95/46 and 97/66.
A14: TRUE
A15: It thus follows from a combined reading of Article 1(5)(b) of Directive 2000/31 and Article 2(4) of the GDPR that the provisions of that directive, in particular Articles 12 to 15 thereof, cannot interfere with the regime under that regulation.
A16: TRUE
A17: That provision has been interpreted by the Court as meaning that questions related to the protection of the confidentiality of communications and personal data must be assessed on the basis of the GDPR and Directive 2002/58.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows, in particular, that the possible benefit of the exemption provided for in Article 14(1) of Directive 2000/31, on which the operator of an online marketplace might be able to rely as regards the information hosted on its website, cannot interfere with the GDPR regime which applies to such an operator in the same way as to any other operator falling within the scope of that regulation.
A24: TRUE
A25: The protection that Directive 2000/31 is intended to ensure cannot, in any event, undermine the requirements under the GDPR and Directive 2002/58.
