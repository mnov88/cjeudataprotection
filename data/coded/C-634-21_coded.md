A7: Credit scoring by a credit information agency constitutes automated individual decision-making under Article 22(1) GDPR when a third party relies strongly on that score for contractual decisions.
A8: Article 22(1), Article 22(2), Article 22(3), Article 22(4), Article 4(4), Article 5, Article 6, Article 13(2)(f), Article 14(2)(g), Article 15(1)(h)

A13: The applicability of that provision is therefore subject to three cumulative conditions, namely, first, that there must be a 'decision', secondly, that that decision must be 'based solely on automated processing, including profiling', and, thirdly, that it must produce 'legal effects concerning [the interested party]' or 'similarly significantly [affect] him or her'.
A14: TRUE
A15: The concept of 'decision' within the meaning of Article 22(1) of the GDPR is thus, as the Advocate General noted in point 38 of his Opinion, capable of including a number of acts which may affect the data subject in many ways, since that concept is broad enough to encompass the result of calculating a person's creditworthiness in the form of a probability value concerning that person's ability to meet payment commitments in the future.
A16: TRUE
A17: Those enhanced requirements as to the lawfulness of automated decision-making and the additional information obligations of the controller and the related additional rights of access of the data subject are explained by the purpose pursued by Article 22 of the GDPR, consisting of protecting individuals against the particular risks to their rights and freedoms represented by the automated processing of personal data, including profiling.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: As follows from a combined reading of Article 22(2) of the GDPR and recital 71 of that regulation, the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing is authorised only in the cases referred to in that Article 22(2), namely where that decision is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller (point (a)), where it is authorised by EU or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests (point (b)), or where it is based on the data subject's explicit consent (point (c)).
A24: TRUE
A25: Thus, any processing of personal data must, first, comply with the principles relating to the processing of data established in Article 5 of the GDPR and, secondly, in the light, in particular, of the principle of the lawfulness of processing, laid down in Article 5(1)(a), satisfy one of the conditions of the lawfulness of the processing listed in Article 6 of that regulation.

A27: TRUE
A28: On the other hand, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, in which three stakeholders are involved, there would be a risk of circumventing Article 22 of the GDPR and, consequently, a lacuna in legal protection if a restrictive interpretation of that provision was retained, according to which the establishment of the probability value must only be considered as a preparatory act and only the act adopted by the third party can, where appropriate, be classified as a 'decision' within the meaning of Article 22(1) of that regulation.
A29: MIXED
A30: TRUE
A31: Text of Article 22(1) was ambiguous as to whether scoring alone constitutes a decision; Court shifted to protective purpose of Article 22 to conclude scoring must be covered to avoid circumvention and protection gaps.
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Broad interpretation of automated decision-making extends Article 22 protections to credit scoring, expanding data subject rights and controller obligations.
