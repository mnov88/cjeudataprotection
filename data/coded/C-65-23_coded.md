A7: National rules adopted under Article 88(1) GDPR for employment data processing must also comply with the requirements of Articles 5, 6(1), and 9(1) and (2) GDPR.
A8: Article 88(1), Article 88(2), Article 5, Article 6(1), Article 9(1), Article 9(2)

A11: DATA_PROTECTION_PRINCIPLES, SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_CONDITIONS
A12: TRUE
A13: However, that wording does not provide any express indication as to whether the 'more specific rules' that the Member States thus have the possibility of adopting must seek to ensure compliance only with the requirements laid down in Article 88(2) of the GDPR or also with those of other provisions of that regulation, so that the processing of personal data carried out pursuant to such rules should also comply with those latter provisions.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 88 of the GDPR appears in Chapter IX thereof, entitled 'Provisions relating to specific processing situations', while Articles 5, 6 and 9 of that regulation appear in Chapter II thereof, entitled 'Principles', which is therefore more general in scope.
A16: TRUE
A17: However, in order not to undermine all of those objectives, and in particular that of ensuring a high level of protection for employees where their personal data are processed in the employment context, Article 88 of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as meaning that the 'more specific rules' which the Member States have the option of adopting pursuant to that article could have the purpose or effect of circumventing the obligations of the controller or processor resulting from other provisions of that regulation.

A23: It follows that Article 88(1) and (2) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, even where Member States rely on that article in order to introduce, into their respective national legal systems, 'more specific rules', by law or by collective agreements, the requirements arising from the other provisions that are specifically referred to in the present question, namely Article 5, Article 6(1) and Article 9(1) and (2) of that regulation, must also be satisfied.
A24: TRUE
A25: In addition, it is settled case-law that any processing of personal data must observe the principles governing the processing of such data and the rights of the data subject set out, respectively, in Chapters II and III of the GDPR.

A7: National courts must conduct full judicial review of collective agreements to verify necessity of data processing, notwithstanding the parties' margin of discretion.
A8: Article 88(1), Article 5, Article 6(1), Article 9(1), Article 9(2)
A9: 88, 5, 6, 9
A10: MEMBER_STATE_DISCRETION

A12: TRUE
A13: By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 88(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, where a collective agreement falls within the scope of that provision, the margin of discretion that the parties to that agreement have to determine whether the processing of personal data is 'necessary', within the meaning of Article 5, Article 6(1) and Article 9(1) and (2) of that regulation, has the effect of preventing the national court from carrying out a full judicial review in that regard.
A14: FALSE
A15: NULL
A16: TRUE
A17: However, such an assessment process must not lead to those parties reaching compromises, on the basis of economic or practical considerations, which would be liable improperly to undermine the GDPR's objective of ensuring a high level of protection of employees' freedoms and fundamental rights with regard to the processing of their personal data.

A23: Therefore, an interpretation of Article 88 of the GDPR according to which national courts could not carry out a full judicial review with regard to a collective agreement, in particular in order to ascertain whether the justifications put forward by the parties to that agreement establish that the processing of personal data under that agreement is necessary, would not be compatible with that regulation, having regard to the objective of protection referred to in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment.
A24: TRUE
A25: As regards the scope of the judicial review that may be carried out with regard to such specific rules, the Court has already held that it is for the national court seised, which alone has jurisdiction to interpret national law, to assess whether those rules do indeed comply with the conditions and limits laid down, in particular, in Article 88 of the GDPR.
A26: C-34/21
A27: TRUE
A28: In accordance with the principle of the primacy of EU law, if that court finds that the provisions of national law concerned do not comply with those conditions and limits, it must then disregard those provisions.
A29: PRINCIPLE_BASED
A30: TRUE
A31: Text could suggest deference to collective agreement parties' assessment, but Court shifted to primacy of EU law and high protection objectives to conclude full judicial review is required.
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Ensures employees can challenge collective agreements that inadequately protect their data rights through full judicial review.
A34: TRUE
A35: REGULAR
A36: The Court required that necessity of processing must be subject to full judicial review, not deferential review, applying regular necessity standards.
A37: TRUE
A38: DATA_SUBJECT
A39: Employees' data protection rights prevail over collective agreement parties' discretion to determine processing necessity through practical compromises.
