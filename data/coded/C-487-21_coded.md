A7: The right to obtain a copy of personal data under Article 15(3) GDPR requires a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all data, including document extracts or entire documents where necessary for effective exercise of rights.

A10: RIGHT_OF_ACCESS
A11: TRANSPARENCY
A12: TRUE
A13: Although the GDPR does not contain a definition of the term 'copy' thus used, account must be taken of the usual meaning of that term, which refers, as the Advocate General observed in point 30 of his Opinion, to the faithful reproduction or transcription of an original, with the result that a purely general description of the data undergoing processing or a reference to categories of personal data does not correspond to that definition.
A14: TRUE
A15: As a result, the first sentence of Article 15(3) of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as establishing a separate right from that provided for in Article 15(1).
A16: TRUE
A17: Thus, the right of access provided for in Article 15 of the GDPR must enable the data subject to ensure that the personal data relating to him or her are correct and that they are processed in a lawful manner.

A23: Article 4(1) of the GDPR defines the concept of 'personal data' as 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person' and specifies that 'an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person'.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, it has been held that information relates to an identified or identifiable natural person where, by reason of its content, purpose or effect, it is linked to an identifiable person.
A26: C-484/20, C-624/20, C-434/16, C-175/20, C-154/21, C-453/21
A27: TRUE
A28: That interpretation corresponds to the objective of the GDPR, which seeks, inter alia, as is apparent from recital 10 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data throughout the European Union.

A42: NONE
A43: Court acknowledges both rights must be balanced, with neither automatically prevailing, though refusal to provide all information to the data subject is not permitted.

A7: The concept of 'information' in Article 15(3) third sentence GDPR refers exclusively to the personal data of which the controller must provide a copy, not to additional metadata.
A8: Article 15(3), Article 12(3)
A9: 15, 12
A10: RIGHT_OF_ACCESS
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Accordingly, it follows from the context of the third sentence of Article 15(3) of the GDPR that the 'information' to which it refers necessarily corresponds to the personal data of which the controller must provide a copy in accordance with the first sentence of that paragraph.
A14: TRUE
A15: It should be noted that no provision of that regulation establishes a difference in treatment of an application according to the form in which it is submitted, with the result that the scope of the right to obtain a copy cannot vary according to that form.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such an interpretation is confirmed by the objectives pursued by Article 15(3) of the GDPR, which are, as recalled in paragraph 31 above, to define the practical arrangements for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.
A18: LEGAL_CERTAINTY

A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: In that regard, although the third sentence of Article 15(3) of the GDPR merely states that, 'where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form', without specifying what is to be understood by the term 'information', the first sentence of that paragraph states that 'the controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing'.
