A11: DATA_PROTECTION_PRINCIPLES
A12: TRUE

A14: TRUE
A15: The processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activity of a search engine can be distinguished from and is additional to that carried out by publishers of websites, consisting in loading those data on an internet page.
A16: TRUE
A17: The operator of the search engine as the person determining the purposes and means of that activity must ensure, within the framework of its responsibilities, powers and capabilities, that the activity meets the requirements of Directive 95/46 and of the GDPR in order that the guarantees laid down by that directive and that regulation may have full effect and that effective and complete protection of data subjects, in particular of their right to privacy, may actually be achieved.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: As provided in Article 17(1), the data subject has, in principle, for the reasons listed therein, the right to obtain the erasure of personal data relating to him or her by the controller.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, the operator of the search engine is responsible not because personal data appear on an internet page published by a third party, but because of the referencing of that page and, in particular, the display of the link to that internet page in the list of results presented to internet users following a search carried out on the basis of an individual's name.
A26: C-131/12, C-136/17, C-709/20, C-345/17
A27: TRUE
A28: A fair balance must be struck between the fundamental rights to privacy and protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, on the one hand, and the fundamental right of freedom of information guaranteed by Article 11 of the Charter, on the other.
A29: PRINCIPLE_BASED
A30: TRUE
A31: The text of Article 17 permits requests without prior court action, but the Court shifted to balancing principles to establish that data subjects must provide evidence of manifest inaccuracy while not being required to first obtain a judicial decision.
A32: MIXED
A33: Establishes that de-referencing is not conditional on prior court action (pro-data subject) but also sets evidentiary burden on data subjects to prove manifest inaccuracy (pro-controller).
A34: TRUE
A35: REGULAR
A36: The Court held that imposing a requirement to first obtain judicial protection against the content provider would impose an unreasonable and excessive burden on data subjects undermining the practical effect of the right to de-referencing.
A37: TRUE
A38: NONE
A39: Data subject rights generally override internet user interests but balance depends on circumstances including public role and information accuracy; neither interest categorically prevails.
A40: TRUE
A41: freedom of expression, freedom of information
A42: NONE
A43: The Court requires balancing between data protection rights and freedom of expression/information without either categorically prevailing, though inaccurate information does not benefit from freedom of information protection.

A10: RIGHT_TO_ERASURE
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: The display, in the results of an image search, of photographs of natural persons in the form of thumbnails constitutes processing of personal data in respect of which the operator of the search engine concerned, as 'controller' within the meaning of Article 2(d) of Directive 95/46 and Article 4(7) of the GDPR, must ensure compliance.
A14: TRUE
A15: By retrieving the photographs of natural persons published on the internet and displaying them separately, in the results of an image search, in the form of thumbnails, the operator of a search engine offers a service in which it carries out autonomous processing of personal data which is distinct both from that of the publisher of the internet page from which the photographs are taken and from that, for which the operator is also responsible, of referencing that page.
A16: TRUE
A17: Since photographs are often open to a number of interpretations, displaying them in the list of search results as thumbnails may result in a particularly serious interference with the data subject's right to protection of his or her image, which must be taken into account when weighing-up competing rights and interests.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, FUNDAMENTAL_RIGHTS
A19: NULL
A20: TELEOLOGICAL
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: The operator of a search engine must ascertain whether displaying the photographs in question is necessary for exercising the right to freedom of information of internet users who are potentially interested in accessing those photographs.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has already stated that the inclusion in the list of results, displayed following a search made on the basis of a person's name, of an internet page and of the information contained on it relating to that person makes access to that information appreciably easier for any internet user making a search in respect of that person and may play a decisive role in the dissemination of that information.
A26: C-131/12, C-136/17, C-184/20
A27: TRUE
A28: A person's image constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality as it reveals the person's unique characteristics and distinguishes the person from others.
A29: PRINCIPLE_BASED
A30: TRUE
A31: The Court moved from textual analysis of processing requirements to the principle that image rights deserve special protection because photographs reveal unique personal characteristics.
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Requires autonomous assessment of thumbnail displays favoring de-referencing since photographs outside original context have limited informative value while causing significant privacy interference.
A34: TRUE
A35: REGULAR
A36: The Court held that display of thumbnails must be assessed for necessity in exercising freedom of information, with photographs outside their original context requiring independent evaluation of their informative value.
A37: TRUE
A38: DATA_SUBJECT
A39: Where photographs have little informative value outside their original context, data subject privacy interests prevail over search engine referencing interests.
A40: TRUE
A41: freedom of expression, freedom of information, right to one's image
A42: DATA_PROTECTION
A43: Data protection prevails for thumbnail images when they lack informative value outside their publication context, as photographs constitute particularly sensitive personal data.
