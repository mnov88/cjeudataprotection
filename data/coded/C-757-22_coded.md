A10: REPRESENTATIVE_ACTIONS
A11: TRANSPARENCY
A12: TRUE
A13: Specifically, as is apparent from the wording of Article 80(2) of the GDPR, the bringing of a representative action on the basis of that provision implies that the infringement of the rights which the data subject derives from that regulation occurs in the course of the processing of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: That interpretation is supported by a comparison of the different language versions of Article 80(2) of the GDPR and by recital 142 thereof, which states that entities meeting the conditions referred to in Article 80(1) of that regulation must have reasons to consider that the rights of a data subject under that regulation have been infringed as a result of 'the processing of personal data which infringes [that] Regulation'.
A16: TRUE
A17: That interpretation is confirmed, first, by the objective of the GDPR, recalled in paragraph 48 above, of ensuring effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, a high level of protection of the right of every person to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data concerning him or her.

A23: It therefore follows from Article 5 of the GDPR that the processing of personal data must, inter alia, satisfy specific requirements of transparency with regard to the data subject concerned by such processing.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, a consumer protection association, such as the Federal Union, may fall within the scope of that concept in that it pursues a public interest objective consisting in safeguarding the rights and freedoms of data subjects in their capacity as consumers, since the attainment of such an objective is likely to be related to the protection of the personal data of those persons.
A26: C-319/20, C-604/22, C-511/18, C-512/18, C-520/18, C-175/20, C-579/21, C-487/21
A27: TRUE
A28: It follows from the foregoing, in the first place, that the controller's obligation to provide information to subjects of the processing of personal data is the corollary of the right to information which is conferred on those data subjects by Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR and which thus forms part of the rights which the representative action provided for in Article 80(2) of that regulation seeks to protect.
