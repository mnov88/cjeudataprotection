A13: Having regard in particular to the repeated use of the term 'translations' in Article 21(2) of Directive 2017/1132, it is apparent from the wording of that provision that it concerns the voluntary disclosure of translations of the documents and particulars referred to in Article 14 of that directive into an official language of the European Union and, therefore, only the language of in which those documents and particulars are published.
A14: TRUE
A15: As regards the context of Article 21(2) of Directive 2017/1132, the title of that article, which refers to the 'Language of disclosure and translation of documents and particulars to be disclosed', as well as the other paragraphs of that article, support the interpretation referred to in paragraph 55 of this judgment.
A16: TRUE
A17: Last, the interpretation referred to in paragraph 55 of this judgment is confirmed by recital 12 thereof, according to which cross-border access to company information should be facilitated by allowing, in addition to compulsory disclosure made in one of the languages permitted in the company's Member State, the voluntary registration in additional languages of the required documents and particulars.

A14: TRUE
A15: It follows from Article 2(d) that the controller is the entity which 'determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data'.
A16: TRUE
A17: In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, according to the case-law of the Court, that provision is intended to ensure, through a broad definition of the concept of 'controller', effective and complete protection of data subjects.

A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has already held that it would be contrary to the objective of Article 4(7) of the GDPR, referred to in paragraph 72 of the present judgment, to exclude the Official Journal of a Member State from the concept of 'controller' on the ground that it does not review the personal data contained in its publications.

A14: TRUE
A15: In accordance with Article 161 of that directive, the processing of personal data carried out in the context of that directive must fully satisfy the requirements arising from the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: It is thus for the Member States, in the context of the implementation of the obligations imposed by that directive, to ensure that the objectives of legal certainty and protection of the interests of third parties pursued by that directive and recalled in paragraph 77 of the present judgment, are reconciled with the rights enshrined in the GDPR and the fundamental right to the protection of personal data, by striking a fair balance between those objectives and those rights.

A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has already held that the activity of a public authority consisting in safeguarding, in a database, data which companies are required to communicate on the basis of legal obligations, permitting interested persons to consult those data and providing them with copies thereof, falls within the exercise of public powers and constitutes a task carried out in the public interest within the meaning of that provision.

A8: Article 4(1)

A12: TRUE
A13: That provision lays down that personal data means 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person' and specifies that 'an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person'.
A14: FALSE
A15: NULL
A16: TRUE
A17: In that connection, the Court has already held that the use of the expression 'any information' in the definition of the concept of 'personal data' in that provision reflects the aim of the EU legislature to assign a wide scope to that concept, which potentially encompasses all kinds of information, not only objective but also subjective, in the form of opinions and assessments, provided that it 'relates' to the data subject.

A14: FALSE
A15: NULL
A16: TRUE
A17: It is apparent not only from the wording of Article 82(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recitals 85 and 146 thereof – which encourage the acceptance of a broad interpretation of the concept of 'non-material damage', within the meaning of that first provision – but also from the objective of ensuring a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data – which is referred to by the regulation – that the fear experienced by a data subject with regard to a possible misuse of his or her personal data by third parties as a result of an infringement of that regulation is capable, in itself, of constituting 'non-material damage', within the meaning of Article 82(1).
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: TELEOLOGICAL
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Article 82(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that the mere infringement of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation, since the existence of 'damage', material or non-material, or of 'damage' which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article 82(1).
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, it is apparent from the illustrative list of types of 'damage' that may be suffered by data subjects, set out in the first sentence of recital 85 of the GDPR, that the EU legislature intended to include in the concept of 'damage' that may be suffered by data subjects, inter alia, the mere 'loss of control' over their own personal data, as a result of an infringement of that regulation, even if there had been no actual misuse of the data in question.
A26: C-300/21, C-741/21, C-340/21, C-687/21, C-456/22, C-590/22, C-182/22, C-189/22, C-667/21
A27: TRUE
A28: The right to compensation laid down in Article 82(1), in particular in the case of non-material damage, fulfils an exclusively compensatory function, in that financial compensation based on that provision must allow the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation to be compensated in full, and not a deterrent or punitive function.

A13: Article 82(3) of the GDPR, for its part, states that a controller is to be exempt from liability under paragraph 2 if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
A14: TRUE
A15: Among the powers listed in Article 58(3) of the GDPR is included, in point (b) of that provision, the power 'to issue, on its own initiative or on request, opinions to the national parliament, the Member State government or, in accordance with Member State law, to other institutions and bodies as well as to the public on any issue related to the protection of personal data'.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such an interpretation of Article 82(3) is also consistent with the objectives pursued by the GDPR of ensuring a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data and of ensuring effective compensation for the damage that they may suffer as a result of processing of those data that infringes that regulation.

A23: Since an opinion issued to the controller is not legally binding, it cannot in itself demonstrate that that the damage is not attributable to that controller, within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 164 of the present judgment, nor, therefore, that it is sufficient to exempt that controller from liability under Article 82(3) of the GDPR.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, it follows from a combined analysis of Article 82(1) to (3) of the GDPR, the context of that article and the objectives pursued by the EU legislature by means of that regulation that that article provides for fault-based liability in which the burden of proof rests not on the person who has suffered damage, but on the controller.
A26: C-340/21, C-741/21, C-667/21
A27: TRUE
A28: If it were sufficient for the controller to rely on a legally non-binding opinion in order to escape all liability and, accordingly, from any obligation to compensate, the controller would not be encouraged to do everything within its power to ensure that high level of protection and to comply with the obligations imposed by that regulation.
