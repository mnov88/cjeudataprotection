A13: The generally accepted meanings of the concept of 'meaningful information' under that provision, in the various language versions of that provision, differ; some, like the French-language version, favour the functionality ('nuttige' in Dutch, 'úteis' in Portuguese) or the relevance ('pertinente' in Romanian) of the information to be provided, while others place greater emphasis on the importance of that information ('significativa' in Spanish and 'istotne' in Polish).

A28: If the individuals affected by an automated decision, including profiling, were not in a position to understand the reasons which led to that decision before expressing their point of view or contesting the decision, those rights would not, accordingly, satisfy in full their purpose of protecting those individuals against the particular risks to their rights and freedoms represented by the automated processing of their personal data.
