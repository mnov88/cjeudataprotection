A13: Neither the GDPR nor any other instrument of EU law provides for specific rules on cooperation between a national competition authority and the relevant national supervisory authorities concerned or the lead supervisory authority.
A14: TRUE
A15: The supervisory authorities, on the one hand, and the national competition authorities, on the other, perform different functions and pursue their own objectives and tasks.
A16: TRUE
A17: Excluding the rules on the protection of personal data from the legal framework to be taken into consideration by the competition authorities when examining an abuse of a dominant position would disregard the reality of this economic development and would be liable to undermine the effectiveness of competition law within the European Union.

A23: Article 55(1) of the GDPR states the general rule that each supervisory authority is to be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to it and the exercise of the powers conferred on it, in accordance with that regulation, on the territory of its own Member State.
A24: TRUE
A25: Under that principle, in accordance with settled case-law, in areas covered by EU law, Member States, including their administrative authorities, must assist each other, in full mutual respect, in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties.

A12: TRUE
A13: Article 9(1) of the GDPR lays down the principle that the processing of special categories of personal data listed therein is prohibited.
A14: TRUE
A15: Recital 51 of the GDPR states that personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms.
A16: TRUE
A17: In view of the significant risks to the fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights of data subjects arising from any processing of personal data falling within the categories referred to in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, the objective thereof is to prohibit such processing, irrespective of its stated purpose.

A24: FALSE
A25: NULL
A26: NULL
A27: TRUE
A28: That fundamental prohibition, laid down in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, is independent of whether or not the information revealed by the processing operation in question is correct and of whether the controller is acting with the aim of obtaining information that falls within one of the special categories referred to in that provision.

A10: CONTRACT_BASIS
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Under point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, that provision provides that processing of personal data is lawful if it is 'necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract'.
A14: TRUE
A15: The fact that such processing may be referred to in the contract or may be merely useful for the performance of the contract is, in itself, irrelevant in that regard.
A16: TRUE
A17: The decisive factor for the purposes of applying the justification set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR is rather that the processing of personal data by the controller must be essential for the proper performance of the contract concluded between the controller and the data subject.

A9: 6, 5, 13
A10: LEGITIMATE_INTERESTS
A11: DATA_PROTECTION_PRINCIPLES
A12: TRUE
A13: That provision provides that the processing of personal data is lawful only if it is 'necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child'.
A14: TRUE
A15: The condition relating to the need for processing must be examined in conjunction with the 'data minimisation' principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: In those circumstances, it must be held that the interests and fundamental rights of such a user override the interest of that operator in such personalised advertising by which it finances its activity, with the result that the processing by that operator for such purposes cannot fall within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.

A23: As the Court has already held, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data covered by that provision is lawful.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, that provision lays down three cumulative conditions so that the processing of personal data covered by that provision is lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by a third party; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the interests or fundamental freedoms and rights of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence over the legitimate interest of the controller or of a third party.
A26: C-597/19, C-439/19, C-708/18
A27: TRUE
A28: Despite the fact that the services of an online social network such as Facebook are free of charge, the user of that network cannot reasonably expect that the operator of the social network will process that user's personal data, without his or her consent, for the purposes of personalised advertising.
A29: CASE_LAW_BASED
A30: FALSE
A31: NULL
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Users' fundamental rights and reasonable expectations override controller's advertising interests; extensive tracking creates a feeling of continuous surveillance that overrides commercial interests.
A34: TRUE
A35: STRICT
A36: The Court requires strict necessity showing the legitimate interest cannot be achieved by less restrictive means, combined with the data minimisation principle.
A37: TRUE
A38: DATA_SUBJECT
A39: User fundamental rights and lack of reasonable expectation of personalised advertising processing override the operator's commercial interest in advertising-funded services.
A40: TRUE
A41: right to respect for private life, right to protection of personal data

A15: Article 6(3) of the GDPR specifies, inter alia, in respect of those two situations in which processing is lawful, that the processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject.
A16: TRUE
A17: That legal basis must meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

A8: Article 6(1)(d), Article 6(1)(e)
A9: 6
A10: VITAL_INTERESTS_BASIS
A11: PUBLIC_INTEREST_BASIS
A12: TRUE
A13: That provision provides that the processing of personal data is lawful where it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
A14: TRUE
A15: As can be seen from recital 46 of that regulation, that provision covers the specific situation in which the processing of personal data is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person.
A16: TRUE
A17: It follows from those examples and from the strict interpretation to be given to point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR that, in view of the nature of the services provided by the operator of an online social network, such an operator, whose activity is essentially economic and commercial in nature, cannot rely on the protection of an interest which is essential for the life of its users or of another person in order to justify, absolutely and in a purely abstract and preventive manner, the lawfulness of data processing.

A14: TRUE
A15: Article 7(4) of the GDPR provides that when assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account must be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such a circumstance must be taken into consideration in assessing whether the user of that network has validly and, in particular, freely given consent, since that circumstance is liable to affect the freedom of choice of that user, who might be unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.
