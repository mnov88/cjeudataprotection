A13: The reference in Article 32(1) and (2) of the GDPR to 'a level of security appropriate to the risk' and to an 'appropriate level of security' shows that that regulation establishes a risk management system and that it in no way purports to eliminate the risks of personal data breaches.
A14: TRUE
A15: Such an obligation to demonstrate the appropriateness of those measures would make no sense if that controller were obliged to prevent all breaches of those data.
A16: TRUE
A17: In so doing, the EU legislature expressed its intention to 'mitigate' the risks of personal data breaches, without claiming that it would be possible to eliminate them.

A24: TRUE
A25: According to settled case-law, the terms of a provision of EU law, such as Articles 24 and 32 of the GDPR, which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purposes of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union.

A13: It is clear from the wording of Article 5(2), Article 24(1) and Article 32(1) of the GDPR that the controller concerned bears the burden of proving that the personal data are processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of those data.
A14: TRUE
A15: Those three articles thus set out a rule of general application, which, in the absence of any indication to the contrary in the GDPR, must also be applied in the context of an action for damages based on Article 82 of that regulation.
A16: TRUE
A17: Since the level of protection provided for by the GDPR is dependent on the security measures adopted by controllers of personal data, those controllers must be encouraged to do everything in their power to prevent the occurrence of processing operations that do not comply with that regulation.

A13: It follows from those provisions, first, that the controller in question must, in principle, make good any damage caused by an infringement of that regulation linked to that processing and, secondly, that it can be exempt from liability only if it proves that it is in no way responsible for the event giving rise to that damage.
A14: TRUE
A15: Where, as in the present case, a personal data breach, within the meaning of Article 4(12) of the GDPR, has been committed by cybercriminals, and therefore by a 'third party', within the meaning of Article 4(10) of that regulation, that infringement cannot be attributed to the controller, unless the controller has made that infringement possible by failing to comply with an obligation laid down in the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: The foregoing interpretation of Article 82(3) is also consistent with the GDPR's objective of ensuring a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data, set out in recitals 10 and 11 of that regulation.

A8: Article 82(1)
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 82(1) of the GDPR does not distinguish between situations in which, as a result of an established infringement of provisions of that regulation, the 'non-material damage' alleged by the data subject is linked to a misuse that has already occurred or is linked to that person's fear that such use may occur in the future.
A14: TRUE
A15: It is apparent from that illustrative list of types of 'damage' that may be suffered by the data subjects that the EU legislature intended to include in those concepts, in particular, the mere 'loss of control' over their own data, as a result of an infringement of that regulation, even if there had been no misuse of the data in question.
A16: TRUE
A17: An interpretation of Article 82(1) of the GDPR to the effect that the concept of 'non-material damage', within the meaning of that provision, does not include situations in which a data subject relies solely on the fear that his or her personal data will be misused by third parties, in the future, would not be consistent with the guarantee of a high level of protection of natural persons.

A24: TRUE
A25: The Court interpreted Article 82(1) of the GDPR as precluding a national rule or practice which makes compensation for 'non-material damage', within the meaning of that provision, subject to the condition that the damage suffered by the data subject has reached a certain degree of seriousness.
