A7: A GDPR infringement alone does not constitute damage; actual damage must be separately established to claim compensation under Article 82(1).

A13: Article 82(1) of the GDPR provides that 'any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.'
A14: TRUE
A15: Since those three cumulative conditions are necessary and sufficient in order to have a right to compensation for the purposes of Article 82(1) of the GDPR, that right cannot be made contingent on an additional demonstration that the data subject has suffered an unjustified interference with the legal interest which that same regulation is intended to protect.
A16: TRUE
A17: That interpretation is thus capable of ensuring the protection of personal data as a fundamental right laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter, to which recital 1 of the GDPR refers.

A20: SEMANTIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: The Court has repeatedly interpreted Article 82(1) to the effect that mere infringement of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation on that basis, since the existence of 'damage', whether material or non-material, or of 'damage' which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in that provision.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has repeatedly interpreted Article 82(1) to the effect that mere infringement of that regulation is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation on that basis.

A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: MEMBER_STATE_DISCRETION
A12: TRUE
A13: In the present case, since the GDPR does not contain any provision intended to define the rules on the assessment of the damages due under the right to compensation laid down in Article 82 of that regulation, national courts must, to that end, apply the domestic rules of each Member State relating to the extent of financial compensation.
A14: TRUE
A15: Likewise, Article 82(1) of the GDPR does not preclude the making of an apology from being able to constitute standalone or supplementary compensation for non-material damage, as laid down in the present case in Article 14 of the Law of 2005, provided that such a form of compensation complies with those principles of equivalence and effectiveness.
A16: TRUE
A17: The exclusively compensatory function of the right to compensation laid down in Article 82 of the GDPR means that the criteria for assessing the compensation due under that article must be prescribed within the legal system of each Member State, provided that such compensation is full and effective.

A20: TELEOLOGICAL
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: According to settled case-law, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights of individuals, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court has accepted that where the damage suffered by the data subject is not serious, a national court may compensate for it by awarding minimal compensation to that person, provided that the small amount of damages thus granted is such as to offset in full that damage.
A26: C-300/21, C-182/22, C-189/22, C-590/22
A27: TRUE
A28: The exclusively compensatory function of the right to compensation laid down in Article 82 of the GDPR means that the criteria for assessing the compensation due under that article must be prescribed within the legal system of each Member State, provided that such compensation is full and effective.

A7: Controller attitude and motivation cannot be used to reduce compensation below the actual damage suffered by the data subject.
A8: Article 82(1), Article 83
A9: 82, 83
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: By contrast, those criteria are not referred to in either Article 82 of that regulation or indeed in recital 146 thereof, which relates specifically to the right to compensation laid down in that latter article.
A14: TRUE
A15: It is apparent from Article 83 of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 148 thereof, that criteria relating to the attitude and motivation of the controller should, inter alia, be taken into account, as an 'aggravating or mitigating factor', in deciding whether it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine and in determining its amount.
A16: TRUE
A17: The exclusively compensatory function of the right to compensation provided for in Article 82(1) of the GDPR precludes the taking into account of the severity and possible intentional nature of the infringement of that regulation by the controller for the purposes of compensation for damage under that provision.
A18: EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Only the damage actually suffered by the data subject must be taken into consideration in order to determine the amount of such monetary compensation.
A24: TRUE
A25: In the light of the differences in wording and purpose existing between Article 82 of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 146 thereof, and Article 83 of that regulation, read in the light of recital 148 thereof, it cannot be found that the assessment criteria specifically set out in Article 83 are applicable mutatis mutandis in the context of Article 82.
A26: C-300/21, C-182/22, C-189/22, C-590/22, C-741/21
A27: TRUE
A28: Having regard to the exclusively compensatory, rather than punitive, function fulfilled by that right to compensation, the gravity of such an infringement cannot influence the amount of damages granted under Article 82(1) and that amount cannot be set at a level that exceeds full compensation for that damage.
