A11: SCOPE_MATERIAL
A12: TRUE
A13: In deliberately not including the adjective 'administrative' in Article 10 of the GDPR, the EU legislature intended to limit the enhanced protection provided for by that provision to the criminal field alone.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 10 of the GDPR is intended to ensure enhanced protection as regards processing which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data at issue, is liable to constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter.
A16: TRUE
A17: It is apparent from recital 10 of the GDPR that that regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice by ensuring a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, which requires the level of protection to be equivalent and homogeneous in all the Member States.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows from Article 10 of the GDPR that processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6(1) is to be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by EU or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has repeatedly held, only the processing of personal data in the course of an activity of the State or of State authorities which was expressly listed in Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 or in the course of an activity which could be classified in the same category was excluded from the scope of that directive.

A10: DATA_PROTECTION_PRINCIPLES
A11: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_CONDITIONS, PUBLIC_INTEREST_BASIS
A12: TRUE
A13: According to the principle of 'data minimisation' in Article 5(1)(c), personal data are to be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 86 of the GDPR expressly requires that public access to official documents must be reconciled with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data.
A16: TRUE
A17: As recital 39 of the GDPR makes clear, that requirement of necessity is not met where the objective of general interest pursued can reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights of data subjects.

A20: TELEOLOGICAL
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: In order to be capable of being considered lawful, processing must fall within one of the cases provided for in Article 6.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has consistently held, the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data are not absolute rights, but must be considered in relation to their function in society and be weighed against other fundamental rights.
A26: C-496/17, C-708/18, C-136/17, C-311/18, C-260/13, C-92/09, C-93/09, C-398/15
A27: TRUE
A28: Under the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.
A29: PRINCIPLE_BASED
A30: TRUE
A31: Text allowed public interest processing under Article 6(1)(e), but Court shifted to proportionality principle to find that public disclosure was not necessary where less restrictive means could achieve road safety objectives.
A32: PRO_DATA_SUBJECT
A33: Finds public disclosure of penalty points data unlawful as disproportionate, prioritizing data subject privacy over transparency and road safety justifications.
A34: TRUE
A35: STRICT
A36: Court applied strict necessity test, finding public disclosure not necessary since road safety objectives could be achieved through less restrictive means like deterrent punishments and training requirements.
A37: TRUE
A38: DATA_SUBJECT
A39: Data subjects' fundamental rights to privacy and data protection override the general interest in public access to penalty points data.
A40: TRUE
A41: public access to official documents, freedom of information
A42: DATA_PROTECTION

A13: NULL
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 1(4) of Directive 2003/98 provides, in essence, that that directive leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data inter alia under EU law, and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set out in the GDPR.

A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Those provisions must, for reasons identical to those set out in the answer to the second question, be interpreted as also precluding national legislation which authorises a public body to disclose data of that kind to economic operators in order for the data to be re-used and disclosed to the public by them.
A24: TRUE
A25: It is clear from the answer to the second question that the provisions of the GDPR must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which obliges the public body responsible for the register in which penalty points are entered to make those data accessible to the public.

A15: By virtue of the principle of primacy of EU law, rules of national law, even of a constitutional order, cannot be allowed to undermine the unity and effectiveness of EU law.
A16: TRUE
A17: The principle that a restriction may be allowed only in the actual judgment ruling upon that interpretation guarantees the equal treatment of the Member States and of other persons subject to EU law, under that law, and fulfils, at the same time, the requirements arising from the principle of legal certainty.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: The interpretation which the Court gives to rules of EU law clarifies and defines the meaning and scope of those rules as they must be or ought to have been understood and applied from the time of their entry into force.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has consistently held, such a restriction may be allowed only in the actual judgment ruling upon the interpretation sought.

A27: TRUE
A28: Even assuming that overriding considerations of legal certainty are capable of leading, by way of exception, to a provisional suspension of the ousting effect which a directly applicable rule of EU law has on national law that is contrary thereto, the conditions of such a suspension can be determined solely by the Court.
A29: CASE_LAW_BASED
A30: FALSE
A31: NULL
A32: NEUTRAL_OR_UNCLEAR
