# The Numbers Behind the Court: An Empirical Account of GDPR Jurisprudence

The Court of Justice has been unusually active when it comes to the GDPR. Over seven years (2019-2025), it issued 67 rulings containing 181 operative holdings—an average of nearly ten cases annually, each typically addressing multiple legal questions. For a regulation that only became applicable in May 2018, this pace of judicial engagement is remarkable.

On the surface, the Court's holdings appear balanced. Holdings end up pro-data subject in approximately 61 percent of cases, with only 13 percent explicitly favoring controllers. The remainder—roughly a quarter—are mixed or genuinely neutral. These numbers might suggest a Court carefully calibrating between competing interests, declining to systematically favor either side.

But this aggregate picture is misleading. It does not account for two crucial factors that fundamentally alter the interpretation of these statistics.

## The Compensation Distortion

First, the majority of pro-controller holdings emerge from a very particular doctrinal context: the Court's Article 82 compensation jurisprudence. Of the 23 holdings classified as pro-controller in the entire dataset, 13—a striking 56.5 percent—concern damages claims. This is not coincidental. Beginning with *C-300/21* in May 2023, the Court has systematically constructed a restrictive compensation framework that requires data subjects to prove actual damage beyond mere GDPR infringement, limits compensation to its compensatory function (rejecting punitive or deterrent damages), and holds that the severity of the controller's fault cannot increase awards.

This doctrinal development has internal coherence. The Court appears to be making tort law largely from scratch within the GDPR framework, balancing legitimate concerns about ensuring effective remedies against equally legitimate concerns about systemic abuse potential. Whether one agrees with its approach or not, the compensation jurisprudence represents the Court seeking balance in a domain where it perceives genuine risks on both sides.

The empirical consequence, however, is dramatic. When compensation holdings are excluded from the analysis, the pro-data subject rate rises from 61 percent to nearly 67 percent. More revealingly, the compensation gap itself is substantial: compensation holdings are pro-data subject only 36 percent of the time, compared to 67 percent for all other holdings—a 31 percentage point difference that is statistically significant and substantively enormous.

If we accept that the compensation cases represent a distinct doctrinal project—one where the Court is genuinely attempting to balance competing interests—then the "real" numbers for the Court's interpretation of substantive GDPR provisions paint a very different picture.

## Domain-by-Domain Analysis

The non-compensation jurisprudence breaks down starkly by domain. Holdings on the material and territorial scope of the GDPR (whether the regulation applies at all) are pro-data subject 88 percent of the time. Holdings on data subject rights—access, erasure, rectification—favor data subjects 81 percent of the time. Even the lawfulness cluster, which includes the contested terrain of processing justifications, yields pro-data subject outcomes 65 percent of the time.

Only the enforcement domain, dragged down by its compensation sub-component, shows anything approaching balance—and even there, much of the apparent balance comes from the Court's strict construction of administrative fines (requiring fault) and its deference to supervisory authorities on enforcement discretion.

## The Coherence Question

Second, aggregate statistics do not capture the substantive impact of doctrinal developments. A systematic analysis of the Court's reasoning reveals that approximately 14 percent of holdings (25 of 181) exhibit what might be termed "doctrinal tension"—cases where the coded legal variables predict one outcome but the Court rules otherwise. The largest cluster involves precisely the compensation holdings discussed above, where the Court invokes "high level of protection" rhetoric while simultaneously imposing restrictive evidentiary requirements.

But the more significant finding may be this: the Court appears to maintain two distinct registers in its GDPR jurisprudence. At the rights-definition stage—determining what protections exist—it is expansive, invoking teleological interpretation and fundamental rights purposes to extend GDPR's reach. At the remedies stage—determining what happens when those rights are violated—it turns restrictive.

This dual register creates a peculiar situation. Data subjects enjoy ever-broader formal protections while facing ever-higher hurdles to vindicate them. The Court has expanded what counts as personal data, who qualifies as a controller, and when GDPR applies—but contracted what data subjects can do about violations beyond filing complaints with supervisory authorities.

## Setting the Stage

These empirical patterns set the stage for what follows. The numbers suggest a Court that has systematically tightened GDPR interpretation at the level of substantive obligations while cabining the consequences of that tightening through restrictive remedial doctrines. Whether this represents sophisticated judicial statecraft or incoherent jurisprudence—or something else entirely—is the question this article addresses.
