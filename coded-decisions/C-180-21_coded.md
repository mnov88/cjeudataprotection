A7: Processing personal data for prosecution serves a different purpose than collection for detection and investigation, but such subsequent processing is permitted under Directive 2016/680 Article 4(2) conditions.

A12: TRUE
A13: It is apparent from the various language versions of that provision, in particular those in Bulgarian, Spanish, German, Greek, English and Italian, that the different purposes referred to in Article 1(1) of that directive correspond to the 'prevention', 'detection', 'investigation' and 'prosecution' of criminal offences and 'the execution of criminal penalties', including the 'safeguarding' against 'threats to public security' and the 'prevention' of such threats.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 4(2) of that directive, in the light of recital 29 thereof, authorises subsequent processing of personal data for a purpose other than that for which those data were collected, where that purpose is among those set out in Article 1(1) of that directive and that processing satisfies the two conditions laid down in Article 4(2)(a) and (b).
A16: TRUE
A17: It follows from this that the EU legislature sought to adopt rules corresponding to the specific features which characterise the activities carried out by the competent authorities in the field governed by that directive, while taking account of the fact that they constitute distinct activities serving purposes specific to them.

A22: TRUE
A23: It can thus be inferred from the very wording of Article 1(1) of Directive 2016/680, read in conjunction with Article 4(2) thereof, that, where personal data have been collected for the purposes of the 'detection' and 'investigation' of a criminal offence and have subsequently been processed for the purposes of 'prosecution', that collection and that processing serve different purposes.
A24: TRUE
A25: According to settled case-law, it is necessary, for the interpretation of a provision of EU law, that account be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part.

A7: The GDPR applies to processing of personal data by a public prosecutor's office when defending the State in civil damages proceedings using data originally collected for criminal purposes.
A8: Article 3(8) Directive 2016/680, Article 9(1) Directive 2016/680, Article 9(2) Directive 2016/680, Article 2(1) GDPR, Article 2(2) GDPR, Article 4(1) GDPR, Article 4(2) GDPR, Article 4(7) GDPR

A10: SCOPE_MATERIAL
A11: CONTROLLER_DEFINITION
A12: TRUE
A13: First of all, it must be borne in mind that 'personal data', within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR, means 'any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person', it being understood that, according to the case-law, that definition is applicable where, by reason of its content, purpose and effect, the information in question is linked to a particular person.
A14: TRUE
A15: It is therefore appropriate for those fields to be addressed by a directive that lays down the specific rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.
A16: TRUE
A17: Those definitions reflect the aim of the EU legislature to assign a broad scope to those two concepts.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION

A23: It should be noted that Article 2(1) of the GDPR defines broadly the material scope of that regulation, which includes any 'processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and … the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system'.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, the Court has held that, as follows from recital 19 of that regulation, the reason for that exception is that the processing of personal data by the competent authorities for the purposes set out in Article 2(2)(d) of the GDPR is governed by a specific EU legal act, namely Directive 2016/680, which was adopted on the same day as the GDPR.

A7: Processing personal data by a public prosecutor's office for State defense in damages proceedings may be lawful under Article 6(1)(e) GDPR as a task carried out in the public interest.

A10: PUBLIC_INTEREST_BASIS
A11: LEGITIMATE_INTERESTS
A12: TRUE
A13: It should be noted that, as the Commission correctly stated in its written observations, it is clear from the wording of the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR that the processing of personal data by a public authority in the performance of its tasks cannot come within the scope of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, relating to the processing of personal data that is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller.
A14: TRUE
A15: As follows from recital 47 of the GDPR and as the Commission has claimed, that latter provision cannot apply to such data processing, since the legal basis of that processing must be provided for by the legislature.
A16: TRUE
A17: First, by exercising the procedural rights that it enjoys as defendant, that public authority preserves the legal certainty of the acts carried out and decisions adopted in the public interest that are being called into question by the applicant.
A18: LEGAL_CERTAINTY, EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It must be borne in mind that Article 6 of the GDPR lists, in a restrictive manner, the cases in which processing of personal data can be regarded as lawful.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, it is irrelevant that, in an action for damages against the State, the public prosecutor's office is, in its capacity as defendant, on an equal footing with the other parties, and does not exercise public powers, as is the case in the performance of its tasks in criminal matters.
A26: C-439/19, C-83/19, C-127/19, C-195/19, C-291/19, C-355/19, C-397/19
A27: TRUE
A28: Second, by its claims and arguments in defence, that public authority is capable of pointing, where such is the case, to the potentially unfounded or excessive nature of the applicant's claims for compensation, with a view, in particular, to preventing the performance of the tasks carried out in the public interest that are being called into question in the action for damages from being hindered by the prospect of actions for damages, where those tasks are liable to harm the interests of individuals.
