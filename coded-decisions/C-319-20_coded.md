A12: TRUE
A13: As is apparent from the very wording of that provision, recalled in paragraph 67 of the present judgment, the lodging of a representative action presupposes only that the entity concerned 'considers' that the rights of a data subject laid down in that regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data and therefore alleges the existence of data processing that is contrary to the provisions of that regulation.
A14: TRUE
A15: In that context, Chapter VIII of that regulation governs, inter alia, the legal remedies enabling the protection of the data subject's rights where his or her personal data have been the subject of processing that is allegedly contrary to the provisions of that regulation.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such an interpretation is consistent with the requirements stemming from Article 16 TFEU and Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and, thus, with the objective pursued by the GDPR consisting in ensuring effective protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, of ensuring a high level of protection of the right of every person to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.

A23: It must be held that a consumer protection association, such as the Federal Union, may fall within the scope of that concept in that it pursues a public interest objective consisting in safeguarding the rights and freedoms of data subjects in their capacity as consumers, since the attainment of such an objective is likely to be related to the protection of the personal data of those persons.
A24: TRUE
A25: It must be recalled that, according to the Court's settled case-law, pursuant to Article 288 TFEU and by virtue of the very nature of regulations and of their function in the system of sources of EU law, the provisions of those regulations generally have immediate effect in the national legal systems without it being necessary for the national authorities to adopt measures of application.
A26: C-645/19, C-40/17
A27: TRUE
A28: Authorising consumer protection associations, such as the Federal Union, to bring, by means of a representative action mechanism, actions seeking to have processing contrary to the provisions of that regulation brought to an end, independently of the infringement of the rights of a person individually and specifically affected by that infringement, undoubtedly contributes to strengthening the rights of data subjects and ensures that they enjoy a high level of protection.
