A7: Employee error in providing documents containing personal data to an unauthorized third party is not sufficient in itself to conclude that the controller's technical and organizational measures were inappropriate.
A8: Article 5, Article 24, Article 32, Article 82
A9: 5, 24, 32, 82
A10: SECURITY
A11: ACCOUNTABILITY
A12: TRUE
A13: It is apparent, accordingly, from the wording of Articles 24 and 32 of the GDPR that the appropriateness of the measures implemented by the controller must be assessed in a concrete manner, taking into account the various criteria referred to in those articles and the data protection needs specifically inherent in the processing concerned and the risks arising from the latter.
A14: TRUE
A15: That literal interpretation is supported by reading Articles 24 and 32 together with Article 5(2) and Article 82 of that regulation, read in the light of recitals 74, 76 and 83 thereof, from which it follows, in particular, that the controller is obliged to mitigate the risks of personal data breaches and not prevent all breaches of those data.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such an allocation of the burden of proof is capable not only of encouraging the controllers of those data of adopting the security measures required by the GDPR, but also in retaining the effectiveness of the right to compensation provided for in Article 82 of that regulation and upholding the intentions of the EU legislature referred to in recital 11 thereof.

A23: Article 24 of the GDPR lays down a general obligation, on the part of the controller of personal data, to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that that processing is performed in accordance with that regulation and to be able to demonstrate this.
A24: TRUE
A25: Therefore, the Court interpreted Articles 24 and 32 of the GDPR as meaning that unauthorised disclosure of personal data or unauthorised access to those data by a 'third party', within the meaning of Article 4, point 10, of that regulation, are not sufficient, in themselves, for it to be held that the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller in question were not 'appropriate', within the meaning of Articles 24 and 32.

A15: The relationship between the rules set out in Article 82 and those set out in Articles 83 and 84 shows that there is a difference between those two categories of provisions, but also complementarity, in terms of encouraging compliance with the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: The right of any person to seek compensation for damage reinforces the operational nature of the protection rules laid down by that regulation and is likely to discourage the reoccurrence of unlawful conduct.

A25: In that regard, the Court held that Article 82 of the GDPR fulfils a function that is compensatory and not punitive, contrary to other provisions of that regulation also contained in Chapter VIII thereof, namely Articles 83 and 84, which have, for their part, essentially a punitive purpose, since they permit the imposition of administrative fines and other penalties, respectively.

A8: Article 82
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: It follows from Article 82 of the GDPR that, first, establishing the liability of the controller is, in particular, subject to fault on the part of the controller, which is presupposed unless it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage, and secondly, Article 82 does not require that the severity of that fault is taken into consideration when setting the amount of the compensation allocated for non-material damage under that provision.
A14: FALSE
A15: NULL
A16: TRUE
A17: Having regard to the compensatory function of the right to compensation laid down in Article 82 of the GDPR, that provision does not require taking into consideration the severity of the infringement of that regulation, that the controller is presumed to have made, while setting the amount of the compensation allocated for non-material damage under that provision, but requires that that amount is set in a way that the damage actually suffered as a result of the infringement of that regulation is compensated in full.

A7: A person seeking compensation must establish both an infringement of the GDPR and that the infringement caused material or non-material damage.
A8: Article 82(1)
A9: 82
A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: It is apparent from the wording of that provision that the mere infringement of the GDPR is not sufficient to confer a right to compensation.
A14: FALSE
A15: NULL
A16: TRUE
A17: The Court stated that a person concerned by an infringement of the GDPR which had negative consequences for him or her is, however, required to demonstrate that those consequences constitute non-material damage, within the meaning of Article 82 of that regulation, since the mere infringement of the provisions thereof are not sufficient to confer a right to compensation.
A18: EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT
A19: NULL
A20: SEMANTIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: The existence of 'damage' or 'harm' which has been 'suffered' constitutes one of the conditions for the right to compensation laid down in Article 82(1), as does the existence of an infringement of that regulation and of a causal link between that damage and that infringement, those three conditions being cumulative.
A24: TRUE
A25: The Court also held that Article 82(1) of the GDPR precludes a national rule or practice which makes compensation for non-material damage, within the meaning of that provision, subject to the condition that the damage suffered by the data subject, as defined in Article 4, point 1, of that regulation, has reached a certain degree of seriousness.

A7: When an unauthorized third party did not become aware of personal data, mere fear of future misuse does not constitute non-material damage sufficient for compensation.

A10: REMEDIES_COMPENSATION
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: Having regard to the absence of any reference in Article 82(1) of the GDPR to the domestic law of the Member States, the concept of 'non-material damage', within the meaning of that provision, must be given an autonomous and uniform definition specific to EU law.
A14: FALSE
A15: NULL
A16: TRUE
A17: The Court held that it is apparent not only from the wording of Article 82(1) of the GDPR, read in the light of recitals 85 and 146 of that regulation, which encourage the acceptance of a broad interpretation of the concept of 'non-material damage' within the meaning of that first provision, but also the objective of ensuring a high level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data, which is referred to by the regulation, that the fear experienced by a data subject with regard to a possible misuse of his or her personal data by third parties as a result of an infringement of that regulation is capable, in itself, of constituting 'non-material damage'.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION

A22: TRUE
A23: However, the fact remains that it is for the applicant in an action for compensation under Article 82 of the GDPR to demonstrate the existence of such damage.
A24: TRUE
A25: Similarly, on the basis of considerations of a literal, systemic and teleological nature, the Court held that the loss of control of the personal data for a short period of time may cause the data subject 'non-material damage', within the meaning of Article 82(1) of the GDPR, giving rise to a right to compensation, subject to that person demonstrating having actually suffered such damage, however minimal.
