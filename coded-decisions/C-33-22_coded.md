A16: TRUE
A17: That interpretation, which already follows from the fact that Article 2(1) of the GDPR does not draw a distinction depending on the identity of the controller concerned, is borne out by Article 4(7) of that regulation, which defines the concept of 'controller' as referring to 'the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data'.

A9: 2, 23
A10: SCOPE_MATERIAL
A11: OTHER_EXEMPTION
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 2(2)(a) of the GDPR, read in the light of recital 16 thereof, is designed solely to exclude from the scope of that regulation the processing of personal data carried out by State authorities in the course of an activity which is intended to safeguard national security or of an activity which can be classified in the same category.
A14: TRUE
A15: The exception provided for in Article 2(2)(a) of the GDPR refers solely to categories of activities which, by their nature, fall outside the scope of Union law, and not to categories of persons, depending on whether they are private or public in nature.
A16: TRUE

A7: Where a Member State establishes only one supervisory authority, Articles 77(1) and 55(1) GDPR directly confer competence on that authority to hear complaints about parliamentary committee data processing.

A9: 77, 55, 51
A10: DPA_POWERS
A11: RIGHT_TO_LODGE_COMPLAINT
A12: TRUE
A13: It is apparent from the wording of those provisions that, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 132 of his Opinion, Article 77(1) and Article 55(1) of the GDPR do not require, for their implementation, the adoption of national implementing measures and are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to have direct effect.
A14: TRUE
A15: Moreover, where the EU legislature intended to limit the supervisory authorities' competence to supervise processing operations of public authorities, it did so expressly, as evidenced by Article 55(3) of the GDPR, pursuant to which those authorities are not competent to supervise processing operations of courts acting in their judicial capacity.
A16: TRUE
A17: Any other interpretation would undermine the effectiveness of Article 55(1) and Article 77(1) of the GDPR and risk weakening the effectiveness of all the other provisions of that regulation that may be the subject of a complaint.

A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: According to settled case-law, under that provision, by virtue of the very nature of regulations and of their function in the system of sources of EU law, the provisions of regulations generally have immediate effect in the national legal systems without its being necessary for the national authorities to adopt measures of application.
A24: TRUE
A25: The effects of the principle of primacy of EU law are binding on all the bodies of a Member State, without, inter alia, provisions of domestic law, including constitutional provisions, being able to prevent that.
A26: C-645/19, C-430/21
A27: TRUE
A28: Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that a Member State's reliance on rules of national law cannot be allowed to undermine the unity and effectiveness of EU law.
A29: PRINCIPLE_BASED

A31: Text was ambiguous on whether DPA competence requires national implementing measures; Court shifted to principle of direct effect and EU primacy to conclude GDPR provisions directly confer competence regardless of national constitutional structure.
