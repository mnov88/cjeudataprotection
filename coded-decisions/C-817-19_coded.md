A12: TRUE
A13: Article 2(2)(d) of the GDPR draws such a distinction, since it is clearly apparent from the wording of that provision that two conditions need to be met for data processing to fall within the scope of the exception it lays down.
A14: TRUE
A15: As is apparent from recital 19 of the GDPR, the reason for that exception is that the processing of personal data by authorities competent for the purposes, inter alia, of the prevention and detection of criminal offences is governed by a more specific EU legal act, namely Directive 2016/680.
A16: TRUE
A17: Directive 2016/680 lays down the specific rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to such processing operations, respecting the specific nature of those activities in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation.

A15: That directive, in Article 1(2) thereof read in conjunction with Article 3(8) and (9) thereof as well as Annex II thereto, circumscribes the purposes for which those data are to be processed.
A16: TRUE
A17: The objectives of the directive are to ensure the internal security of the European Union and thus protect the life and safety of persons, while creating a legal framework that guarantees a high level of protection of passengers' fundamental rights.

A12: TRUE
A13: It follows from that wording that the other competent national authority thus referred to is an alternative to the judicial authority and, accordingly, must have a level of independence and impartiality similar to the latter.
A14: TRUE
A15: That analysis is supported by the objective of the PNR Directive, mentioned in recital 25 thereof, to ensure the highest level of data protection concerning access to the full PNR data.
A16: TRUE
