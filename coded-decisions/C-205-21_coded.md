A7: Processing of biometric and genetic data by police is authorized by Member State law if that law contains a sufficiently clear and precise legal basis, even if it incorrectly references the GDPR instead of Directive 2016/680.

A12: TRUE
A13: It follows from the case-law recalled in the previous paragraph of the present judgment that there can be no uncertainty as to the provisions of EU law pursuant to which national law may authorise processing of biometric and genetic data, such as the processing at issue in the main proceedings, or as to the applicable conditions governing that authorisation.
A14: TRUE
A15: Whilst the national legislature has the option to provide, in the same legislative instrument, for the processing of personal data for purposes covered by Directive 2016/680 and for other purposes covered by the GDPR, it has, on the other hand, the obligation, in accordance with the requirements set out in the previous paragraph of the present judgment, to make sure that there is no ambiguity as to the applicability of one or other of those two EU acts to the collection of biometric and genetic data.
A16: TRUE
A17: Data subjects and the courts having jurisdiction must be in a position to be able to determine precisely, in particular, the conditions under which that processing may take place and the purposes which it may lawfully pursue.

A22: TRUE
A23: The legal basis authorising such a limitation must define the scope of that limitation sufficiently clearly and precisely.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, it is clear from the Court's case-law that that requirement means that the legal basis authorising such a limitation must define the scope of that limitation sufficiently clearly and precisely.

A7: National legislation may allow courts to authorize compulsory collection of biometric and genetic data from accused persons without assessing evidence, provided effective judicial review is subsequently guaranteed.

A13: The existence of sufficient items of evidence pointing to a person's guilt constitutes, in principle, a serious ground for believing that he or she has committed the offence at issue.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 6 of Directive 2016/680 obliges the Member States to provide for the controller, 'where applicable and as far as possible', to make a clear distinction between personal data of different categories of data subjects.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such collection may contribute to the objective set out in recital 27 of Directive 2016/680, which states that, for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, it is necessary for competent authorities to process personal data collected in the context of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of specific criminal offences beyond that context in order to develop an understanding of criminal activities and to make links between different criminal offences detected.

A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It follows that Article 6(a) of Directive 2016/680 does not preclude national legislation which provides for the compulsory collection, in order to be entered in a record, of biometric and genetic data concerning persons in respect of whom sufficient evidence is gathered that they are guilty of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution and who have been accused for that reason.
A24: TRUE
A25: As the Court has already held, the protection of personal data resulting from the explicit obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of the Charter is especially important for the right to respect for private life.

A32: PRO_CONTROLLER
A33: The holding permits compulsory data collection without full judicial review at the initial stage, favoring law enforcement operational needs over immediate data subject protection.
A34: TRUE
A35: REGULAR
A36: The Court found that limiting judicial review at the preliminary criminal procedure stage may be justified where it might impede criminal investigations, provided subsequent effective review is guaranteed.
A37: TRUE
A38: CONTROLLER
A39: Law enforcement interests in effective criminal investigation temporarily outweigh data subject's right to immediate full judicial review, subject to subsequent review guarantees.
A40: TRUE
A41: presumption of innocence, right to effective judicial protection
A42: NONE
A43: Both rights are accommodated: presumption of innocence is preserved because the court does not assess guilt, and effective judicial protection is ensured through subsequent review mechanisms.

A7: National legislation providing for systematic collection of biometric and genetic data of all persons accused of intentional public prosecution offences is precluded without verification that collection is strictly necessary.
A8: Article 10 Directive 2016/680, Article 4(1)(a)-(c) Directive 2016/680, Article 8(1)-(2) Directive 2016/680

A10: SPECIAL_CATEGORIES_CONDITIONS
A11: DATA_PROTECTION_PRINCIPLES
A12: TRUE
A13: As is set out in Article 10 of Directive 2016/680, the requirement that the processing of such data be allowed 'only where strictly necessary' must be interpreted as establishing strengthened conditions for lawful processing of sensitive data.
A14: TRUE
A15: The specific requirements of Article 10 of Directive 2016/680 constitute a special form of implementation, applicable to certain categories of data, of the principles set out in Articles 4 and 8 of that directive, which must be observed by any data processing falling within the directive's scope.
A16: TRUE
A17: The purpose of that article is to ensure enhanced protection with regard to that processing, which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data at issue and the context in which they are processed, is liable, as is apparent from recital 37 of the directive, to create significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms.
A18: HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION, FUNDAMENTAL_RIGHTS
A19: NULL
A20: TELEOLOGICAL
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: It must be held that national legislation which provides for the systematic collection of the biometric and genetic data of any person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution is, in principle, contrary to the requirement laid down in Article 10 of Directive 2016/680 that processing of the special categories of data referred to in that article is to be allowed 'only where strictly necessary'.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, first, it must be borne in mind, as is apparent from recital 26 of Directive 2016/680, that the requirement of necessity is met where the objective pursued by the data processing at issue cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights of data subjects.
A26: C-136/17, C-184/20
A27: TRUE
A28: In view of the foregoing, it must be held that national legislation which provides for the systematic collection of the biometric and genetic data of any person accused of an intentional offence subject to public prosecution is, in principle, contrary to the requirement laid down in Article 10 of Directive 2016/680.

A34: TRUE
A35: STRICT
A36: Article 10 requires processing of sensitive data to be allowed only where strictly necessary, establishing a heightened standard requiring particularly rigorous assessment compared to ordinary necessity.
A37: TRUE
A38: DATA_SUBJECT
A39: Data subject's fundamental rights to privacy and data protection prevail over generalized law enforcement interests in systematic biometric data collection.
A40: TRUE
A41: right to respect for private life, right to protection of personal data
A42: DATA_PROTECTION
A43: Enhanced protection of sensitive biometric and genetic data prevails, requiring individualized strict necessity assessment rather than blanket collection for crime prevention purposes.
