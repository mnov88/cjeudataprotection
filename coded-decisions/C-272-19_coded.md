A10: CONTROLLER_DEFINITION
A11: SCOPE_MATERIAL
A12: TRUE
A13: Article 4(7) of that regulation defines the 'controller' as being the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
A14: TRUE
A15: Since Article 2(2)(a) of that regulation constitutes an exception to the very wide definition of the scope of that regulation set out in Article 2(1) of that regulation, Article 2(2)(a) must be interpreted restrictively.
A16: TRUE
A17: That applies a fortiori with respect to Regulation 2016/679, which is based on Article 16 TFEU, which states that the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are to lay down the rules relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by, in particular, Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Union law, and the rules relating to the free movement of such data.

A22: TRUE
A23: Accordingly, the definition of the concept of 'controller' in Regulation 2016/679 is not confined to public authorities, but, as emphasised by the Czech Government, is sufficiently wide to include any body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
A24: TRUE
A25: It must be recalled that the Court has already had occasion to state, in relation to Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46, which is based on Article 100a of the EC Treaty (which became, after amendment, Article 95 EC), that recourse to that legal basis does not presuppose the existence of an actual link with free movement between Member States in every situation referred to by the measure founded on that legal base.
