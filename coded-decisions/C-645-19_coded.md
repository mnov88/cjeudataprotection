A14: TRUE
A15: Article 3(1) of Regulation 2016/679, which governs the territorial scope of that regulation, provides, in that regard, that the regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the European Union, whether or not the processing takes place in the European Union.

A24: TRUE
A25: Having regard to the objective pursued by Regulation 2016/679, the condition that the processing of personal data must be carried out 'in the context of the activities' of the establishment concerned, cannot be interpreted restrictively (see, by analogy, judgment of 5 June 2018, Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein, C-210/16).

A24: TRUE
A25: It should be borne in mind that a new rule of law applies from the entry into force of the act introducing it, and, while it does not apply to legal situations that have arisen and become definitive under the old law, it does apply to their future effects, and to new legal situations.

A14: TRUE
