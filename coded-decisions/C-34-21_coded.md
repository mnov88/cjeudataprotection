A7: National legislation cannot constitute a more specific rule under Article 88(1) GDPR where it does not satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 88(2) GDPR.

A10: MEMBER_STATE_DISCRETION
A11: LEGAL_OBLIGATION_BASIS
A12: TRUE
A13: As regards the wording of Article 88(1) of the GDPR, it is apparent, first of all, from the use of the words 'more specific' that the rules referred to in that provision must have a normative content specific to the area regulated, which is distinct from the general rules of that regulation.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 88 of the GDPR, which forms part of Chapter IX of that regulation entitled 'Provisions relating to specific processing situations', constitutes such an opening clause, since it gives Member States the option of adopting 'more specific rules' to ensure protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context.
A16: TRUE
A17: The interpretation that the discretion of the Member States, when adopting rules on the basis of Article 88(1) of the GDPR, is limited by paragraph 2 of that article, is consistent with the objective of that regulation, recalled in paragraph 51 above, which is to ensure the harmonisation of national legislation on the protection of personal data which is, in principle, complete.

A23: Therefore, first, those rules cannot be limited to reiterating the provisions of that regulation and must seek to protect employees' rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of their personal data in the employment context and include suitable and specific measures to protect the data subjects' human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights.
A24: TRUE
A25: Furthermore, when the Member States exercise the option granted to them by the opening clause of the GDPR, they must use their discretion under the conditions and within the limits laid down by the provisions of that regulation and must therefore legislate in such a way as not to undermine the content and objectives of that regulation.
A26: C-319/20, C-175/20, C-439/19, C-302/20
A27: TRUE
A28: As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in points 56, 70 and 73 of his Opinion, the possibility for Member States to adopt 'more specific rules' on the basis of Article 88(1) of the GDPR may lead to a lack of harmonisation within the scope of those rules.

A7: Non-compliant national provisions on employee data processing must be disregarded unless they constitute a valid legal basis under Article 6(3) GDPR.
A8: Article 88(1), Article 88(2), Article 6(3), Article 6(1)(c), Article 6(1)(e)

A12: TRUE
A13: Therefore, in the absence of more specific rules that comply with the conditions and limits prescribed by Article 88 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data in the employment context, both in the private and public sectors, is directly governed by the provisions of that regulation.
A14: TRUE
A15: Article 6(3) of the GDPR provides, first, with regard to those two situations where processing is lawful, referred to respectively in points (c) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of that regulation, that the processing must be based on EU law or on Member State law to which the controller is subject.
A16: TRUE
A17: In accordance with the principle of the primacy of EU law, provisions of the Treaties and directly applicable measures of the institutions have the effect, in their relations with the internal law of the Member States, merely by entering into force, of rendering automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of national law.
A18: HARMONIZATION, LEGAL_CERTAINTY
A19: NULL
A20: SYSTEMATIC
A21: TRUE
A22: TRUE
A23: Consequently, where the referring court finds that the national provisions on the processing of personal data in the employment context do not comply with the conditions and limits laid down in Article 88(1) and (2) of the GDPR, it must still verify whether those provisions constitute a legal basis referred to in Article 6(3) of that regulation, read in conjunction with recital 45, which complies with the requirements laid down in that regulation.
A24: TRUE
A25: It should be pointed out that the Court has already held that lawful processing of personal data by the controllers on the basis of point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the GDPR presupposes not only that they can be regarded as performing a task carried out in the public interest, but also that the processing of personal data for the purpose of performing such a task is founded on a legal basis referred to in Article 6(3) of that regulation.

A28: In accordance with the principle of the primacy of EU law, provisions of the Treaties and directly applicable measures of the institutions have the effect, in their relations with the internal law of the Member States, merely by entering into force, of rendering automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of national law.
