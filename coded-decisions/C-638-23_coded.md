A25: The Court has already ruled that it is apparent from the clear wording of Article 4(7) of the GDPR that a controller may be not only a natural or legal person, but also a public authority, an agency or a body, and such entities do not necessarily have legal personality under national law.

A28: The direct designation, by the national legislature, of an entity as controller contributes to the objective of legal certainty pursued by the GDPR, as is apparent from recital 7 thereof, by allowing natural persons whose personal data are subject to processing to easily identify the entity responsible for ensuring compliance with the rights conferred on them by that regulation.
