A13: It must be noted that the wording of Article 14(5)(c) of the GDPR does not limit the exception which it lays down merely to personal data obtained by the controller from a person other than the data subject, nor does it exclude data generated by the controller itself, in the performance of its tasks, from such data.
A14: TRUE
A15: Therefore, it follows from the combined interpretation of Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR that both personal data obtained by the controller from a person other than the data subject, and data generated by the controller itself – which, on account of their nature, have also not been obtained from the data subject – fall within the scope of Article 14.
A16: TRUE
A17: Article 14(5)(c) of the GDPR must be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the objective pursued by that regulation, which consists, inter alia, as is apparent from Article 1 thereof, read in the light of recitals 1 and 10 thereof, in ensuring a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data.

A23: Article 14(1), (2) and (4) of that regulation specifies the information which the controller must provide to the data subject, within the meaning of Article 4(1) of that regulation, where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject.
A24: TRUE
A25: In order to determine whether that exception covers personal data generated by the controller itself – in the performance of its tasks – from data obtained from a person other than the data subject, it is necessary, in accordance with settled case-law, to consider not only the wording of the provision laying down that exception but also its context and the objectives pursued by the legislation of which it forms part.

A13: The GDPR does not include any provision such as to exclude certain aspects of the application of the exception laid down in Article 14(5)(c) of that regulation from the competence of those supervisory authorities.
A14: TRUE
A15: In the light of the respective wording of those two provisions, it should be noted that the obligations enshrined in Article 32 of the GDPR, which must be complied with in all circumstances and irrespective of whether or not there is an obligation to provide information under Article 14 of that regulation, differ in nature and scope from the obligation to provide information laid down in Article 14 of that regulation.
A16: TRUE
A17: The provisions of EU or Member State law which provide for such measures and to which the controller is subject must guarantee a level of protection of the data subject with regard to the processing of his or her personal data which is at least equivalent to that provided for in Article 14(1) to (4) of that regulation.
