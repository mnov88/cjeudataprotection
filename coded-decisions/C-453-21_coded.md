A7: National legislation may require just cause for dismissing a DPO beyond GDPR requirements, provided such legislation does not undermine GDPR objectives.

A12: TRUE
A13: The second sentence of Article 38(3) of the GDPR provides that 'he or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his [or her] tasks'.
A14: TRUE
A15: That interpretation is supported, in the third place, by the context of that provision and, in particular, by the legal basis on which the EU legislature adopted the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such independence must necessarily enable them to carry out those tasks in accordance with the objective of the GDPR, which seeks, inter alia, as is apparent from recital 10 thereof, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union.

A23: It follows that each Member State is free, in the exercise of its retained competence, to lay down more protective specific provisions on the dismissal of the DPO, in so far as those provisions are compatible with EU law and, in particular, with the provisions of the GDPR.
A24: TRUE
A25: In that regard, in its judgment of 22 June 2022, Leistritz (C-534/20, EU:C:2022:495, paragraphs 20 and 21), the Court, after observing that the GDPR does not define the terms 'dismissed', 'penalised' and 'for performing his [or her] tasks' in the second sentence of Article 38(3) of the GDPR, stated, first, that, in accordance with the meaning which those words have in everyday language, the prohibition of the dismissal, by a controller or processor, of a DPO or of the imposition, by a controller or processor, of a penalty on him or her means that that DPO must be protected against any decision terminating his or her duties.
A26: C-534/20
A27: TRUE
A28: Thus, the second sentence of Article 38(3) of the GDPR, by protecting the DPO against any decision which terminates his or her duties, places him or her at a disadvantage or constitutes a penalty, where such a decision relates to the performance of his or her tasks, must be regarded as seeking essentially to preserve the functional independence of the DPO and, therefore, to ensure that the provisions of the GDPR are effective.

A13: As set out in the second sentence of Article 38(6) of the GDPR, 'the [DPO] may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests'.
A14: TRUE
A15: As regards the context of which Article 38(6) of the GDPR forms part, it should be noted that, according to Article 39(1)(b) of the GDPR, the task of the DPO is, inter alia, to monitor compliance with the GDPR.
A16: TRUE
A17: As regards that objective, it should, in the second place, be noted that that provision is, in essence, intended, as are the other provisions referred to in paragraph 25 of the present judgment, to preserve the functional independence of the DPO and, consequently, to ensure the effectiveness of the provisions of the GDPR.
A18: EFFECTIVE_ENFORCEMENT, HIGH_LEVEL_OF_PROTECTION

A21: TRUE

A25: NULL
A26: NULL
A27: TRUE
