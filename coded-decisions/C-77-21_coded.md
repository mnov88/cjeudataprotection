A7: The purpose limitation principle does not preclude copying personal data to a test database for testing and error correction where such processing is compatible with the initial collection purposes.

A13: It is thus apparent from the wording of that provision that it comprises two requirements, one relating to the purposes of the initial collection of the personal data and the other concerning the further processing of those data.
A14: TRUE
A15: It follows from a combined reading of Article 5(1)(b), Article 6(1)(a) and Article 6(4) of Regulation 2016/679 that the question of the compatibility of the further processing of personal data with the purposes for which those data were initially collected arises only if the purposes of that further processing are not identical to the purposes of the initial collection.
A16: TRUE
A17: Furthermore, in the third place, as the Advocate General emphasised, in essence, in point 27 of his Opinion, those criteria limit the reuse of personal data previously collected by ensuring a balance between, on the one hand, the need for predictability and legal certainty regarding the purposes of the processing of personal data previously collected and, on the other hand, the recognition of a degree of flexibility for the controller in the management of those data, and thereby contribute to the attainment of the objective of ensuring a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons, which is set out in recital 10 of Regulation 2016/679.

A23: In accordance with settled case-law, the interpretation of a provision of EU law requires account to be taken not only of its wording, but also of its context, and the objectives and purpose pursued by the act of which it forms part.
A24: TRUE
A25: It should be recalled that it follows from settled case-law of the Court that it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court.

A7: The storage limitation principle precludes retaining personal data in a test database longer than necessary for conducting tests and correcting errors.

A10: DATA_PROTECTION_PRINCIPLES
A11: NULL
A12: TRUE
A13: It is thus unequivocally clear from the wording of that article that the principle of 'storage limitation' requires the controller to be able to demonstrate, in accordance with the principle of accountability referred to in paragraph 24 of the present judgment, that personal data are kept only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or for which they have been further processed.
A14: TRUE
A15: First, as is apparent from such Article 6, where the data subject has not given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes, in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679, the processing must, as is apparent from Article 6(1)(b) to (f), satisfy a requirement of necessity.
A16: TRUE
A17: Such an interpretation is, in the third place, consistent with the objective pursued by Article 5(1)(e) of Regulation 2016/679, which, as was recalled in paragraph 48 of the present judgment, is, inter alia, to ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European Union with regard to the processing of personal data.

A24: TRUE
A25: It follows that even initially lawful processing of data may over time become incompatible with Regulation 2016/679 where those data are no longer necessary for such purposes and that the data must be erased when those purposes have been served.

A34: TRUE
A35: REGULAR
A36: The Court applied the necessity standard from Article 5(1)(e), finding data must not be kept longer than necessary for the specific purpose, and the controller's oversight excuse was irrelevant.
