A14: TRUE
A15: The combined provisions of Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR and Article 6(3) thereof therefore require there to be a legal basis – national in particular – which serves as a basis for the processing of personal data by the relevant controllers acting in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, such as those performed by courts acting in their judicial capacity.
A16: TRUE
A17: Those objectives include, in accordance with Article 23(1)(f) of that regulation, 'the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings', which, as the European Commission noted in its written observations, must be understood as referring to the protection of the administration of justice from internal or external interference, but also to the proper administration of justice.

A24: TRUE
A25: It follows that a processing operation which falls within the material scope of the GDPR includes not only the creation and maintenance of the electronic staff register (see, by analogy, judgment of 30 May 2013, Worten, C-342/12, EU:C:2013:355, paragraph 19), but also the production as evidence of a document, whether digital or physical, containing personal data, ordered by a court in the context of judicial proceedings.

A15: Any processing of personal data must, subject to the derogations permitted in Article 23 thereof, observe the principles governing the processing of personal data and the rights of the person concerned set out, respectively, in Chapters II and III of that regulation.
A16: TRUE
A17: However, as recital 4 of the GDPR states, the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right, but must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, against other fundamental rights, such as the right to effective judicial protection, guaranteed in Article 47 of the Charter.

A24: TRUE
A25: In particular, any processing of personal data must, first, comply with the principles set out in Article 5 of that regulation and, second, satisfy the lawfulness conditions listed in Article 6 of the same regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 October 2020, La Quadrature du Net and Others, C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, EU:C:2020:791, paragraph 208 and the case-law cited).

A27: TRUE
A28: So far as concerns the interests involved in civil court proceedings, the national court must, as is apparent in particular from recitals 1 and 2 of the GDPR, guarantee the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, which is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8(1) of the Charter and in Article 16 TFEU.
A29: PRINCIPLE_BASED
